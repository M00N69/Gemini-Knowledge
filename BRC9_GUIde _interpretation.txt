INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE 
Part I 
Introduction 
Welcome to the interpretation guideline for the ninth issue of the Global Standard Food Safety (hereafter referred  to as the Standard). The interpretation guideline is designed to accompany Issue 9 of the Standard and should  be read in conjunction with it. The full details of the certification process and protocol are contained within the  Standard. 
This document helps in the understanding of each requirement of the Standard and identifies methods of  compliance. 
Examples are given to explain the type of documents, procedures and level of detail that would be required by a  certification auditor. 
The contents of the guideline are designed to help interpret the Standard across all food sectors; however, the exact  requirements for any particular product, process or site will be specific to that industry and situation. Users of the  guideline are therefore cautioned not to rely solely on the information provided here, but also to reconfirm needs  on a product-by-product basis. Both legislative and voluntary safety requirements change frequently, highlighting  the need for regular checks of precise requirements. 
While adherence to the guideline does not specifically form part of the requirement to achieve certification to the  Standard (i.e. it does not form part of the audit requirements), companies will need to demonstrate that they have  taken account of the topics addressed within this guideline. Examples are given as points to consider but should  always be used in the correct context relevant to the business. Practices should be able to withstand challenge by an  auditor and be in line with good industry practices. 
Achieving a particular requirement is based on evidence collected, observations made during the audit, and on  the procedures expected within that industry sector. The level of non-conformity assigned by an auditor against a  requirement of the Standard is an objective judgement with respect to severity and risk. It is based on the evidence  seen during the audit and independently verified by the certification body management. 
Certification to the Standard 
Why is certification required? 
Certification to the Standard was developed to establish a common standard for food safety and product quality  management. It allows brand owners to demonstrate control and satisfy legal responsibility for products and  consumer safety, as well as reducing audit duplication for manufacturers. The Standard has become a benchmark for  best practice and is recognised worldwide by brand owners and manufacturers in the supply chain, with more than  20,000 food companies now certificated to the Standard. The Standard has been developed for manufacturers of  food; however, certification throughout the supply chain is available through other BRCGS Standards: 
• Global Standard Agents and Brokers 
• Global Standard Consumer Products 
• Ethical Trade and Responsible Sourcing 
• Gluten-Free Certification Program Global Standard 
• Global Standard Packaging Materials 
• Plant-Based Global Standard

First steps to gaining certification 
Self-audit or gap analysis 
Once the decision has been made by the company to pursue certification to the Standard, the requirements need to  be understood. The site needs to be assessed with regard to its current status, and areas that need to be improved  must be identified. This may, for example, relate to the structure of buildings, equipment requirements, the design of  processes or the documentation and implementation of procedures. The company needs to establish an action plan. 
Relevant staff need to understand what is expected. Training courses or further information are available and may be  useful. 
A gap analysis or self-audit needs to be conducted. This could be undertaken in-house; for example, it could be  incorporated into the company’s internal audit process. However, it may require external resources in the form of  consultancy expertise, or a pre-assessment may be undertaken by the company’s chosen certification body. 
Once the company has reviewed the gaps between the requirements and its current practices, the company’s senior  
I 
I
 
management needs to establish a plan to ensure that work is undertaken to fulfil the requirements. This could  
t
r
include, for example, updating of policies and procedures, training of staff, capital expenditure for equipment and  
a
P
maintenance of the building. 
Who undertakes certification audits? 
BRCGS does not undertake the audits itself. BRCGS is the Standard owner, documenting the requirements on behalf  of stakeholders and controlling the operation of the certification scheme. The Standard is written by a committee  of international representatives, coordinated by BRCGS, including retailers, food industry representatives and  certification bodies. The BRCGS team then controls how audits are undertaken through the specification of the audit  protocol and supporting rules and regulations for certification bodies undertaking the certification audits. Monitoring  of certification bodies is undertaken through independent accreditation – for example, by the United Kingdom  Accreditation Service (UKAS) or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), operating to internationally  recognised protocols – and by BRCGS. 
Therefore, a BRCGS-approved certification body needs to be selected by the company. There is a worldwide choice  of such bodies; a list can be found in the BRCGS Directory. Certification bodies need to be appropriately qualified to  undertake the audit and conform to the company’s and its customers’ requirements. 
Cost of audits 
Audit costs vary and are set by the individual certification bodies. They may include the expenses of the auditor (e.g.  travel). 
s 
e
c
Typically, the audit consists of 2 to 3 days on site, depending on factors such as company size (in terms of staff  
i
d
numbers and size of site), the complexity of the manufacturing process, communication difficulties (e.g. language)  
n
e
and difficulties during the audit. 
p
p
A
A full list of factors is given in the Standard and an audit duration calculator is available on the BRCGS website. In  addition, time is needed to write up the report – typically 0.5–1 day. As with most purchases, the cost should be  clearly stated and agreed between the company and the certification body prior to entering into the contract.
brcgs.com 7 
FOOD SAFETY 
ISSUE 9 
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE 
Note that certification is a continual process, and it is a feature of the scheme that the certification body has the  option to visit a certificated company at any stage of certification to ensure that certification principles are being  upheld. This may arise through the receipt of further information, such as a complaint from a customer of the site,  and a charge may be made for any subsequent visits or investigations. 
A service package fee is payable directly to BRCGS through the certification body for every audit undertaken. 
The company also needs to consider investment costs that may be incurred to ensure the company is operating to  the level required by the Standard, including site standards, training and procedural costs. 
When can the audit be undertaken? 
The company and the chosen certification body should agree a mutually convenient date for announced audits  and re-audits to ensure that the company retains ongoing certification. (For certificated sites this may be yearly or  6-monthly, depending on the grade attained.) The company may wish to choose a date when: 
• products that need to be included within the scope of the certificate are being manufactured • personnel to be involved in the audit process are available. 
Ongoing re-audit dates need to be considered since the announced re-audit date will fall between 11 and 12 months  from the original audit date (or 5 to 6 months from the original audit date if a Grade C or D is obtained, where  re-audit is required after 6 months). 
What to expect on the audit day(s) 
The auditor/certification body shall have confirmed to the company the time of arrival on site and may have  provided a summary of the audit schedule. The duration of the audit, although planned in advance, will depend on  the activities on the day, but it may be shortened if a site is well-organised and information provided in advance as  requested by the certification body. 
The audit consists of the following activities: 
• Opening meeting, to be attended by all relevant company personnel (including the most senior production or  operations manager on site), to confirm: 
• the scope and process of the audit 
• highlight any key timings; for example, when specific activities will be completed 
• any staff who will need to be available to discuss specific aspects of the site operations • documents that need to be provided 
• any logistics, such as rooms for on-site activities, availability of protective clothing, etc. • Review of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) or product safety plan documentation (where a  site has multiple HACCP or product safety plans each will be reviewed). 
• Production and storage area audits – it is normal for the auditor to enter production early in the audit, as this  provides a clear understanding of the production processes. During the course of the audit, the auditor will need  to visit production on multiple occasions; for example, to audit different activities as they occur. • Document review. 
• Vertical audits, traceability exercises and the checks of associated records and documentation. • Final review of findings by the auditor(s) – preparation for the closing meeting. 
• Closing meeting – to review audit findings with the company. 
The auditor will need to see the manufacturing process in operation around the site, checking and challenging  the operation of the company’s procedures. The auditor will check policies, procedures and records for objective  evidence that requirements are being met, will ask for specific details and will speak to a variety of staff. After the

audit, the auditor will require some quiet time to write up evidence and collate details of non-conformities, in  preparation for the closing meeting with the company, where the audit is summed up and details of the findings,  including non-conformities, are given. 
Audits – is there anything different? 
Issue 9 of the Standard includes three different audit options: 
• announced on-site audit 
• announced blended audit 
• unannounced on-site audit. 
Announced audits (with mandatory 1 in 3 unannounced) 
Due to the added confidence provided by unannounced audits, the GFSI Benchmark Version 2020 introduced a new  requirement for certificated sites to have at least 1 unannounced audit every 3 years, even where they have opted  to be part of the announced audit programme. Therefore, this requirement has been added to the announced audit  protocol. 
For sites that have not previously been certificated to a GFSI Standard, the certification body will agree which year  within the first 3 years of certification will be unannounced, thereafter the unannounced audit will normally occur  
I 
I
 
once every 3 years, unless the site opts into the voluntary unannounced programme (see below). 
t
r
a
P
The remaining aspects of the announced audit programme remain unchanged from Issue 8. 
The announced, on-site audit programme (including the mandatory unannounced audit every 3 years) remains  available to all sites. Full details can be found in the Standard (Part III, section 2). 
Blended announced audits 
With the evolving role of technology in the supply chain, auditing activity is adapting to incorporate remote  assessment elements into the process, with the overall aim of evaluating evidence objectively, to determine  the extent to which the audit criteria are being fulfilled. Introduction of the blended audit option provides an  opportunity for sites to engage with the auditor using information and communications technology (ICT). 
The blended audit has several stages: 
• it commences with a risk assessment, completed by the certification body, to confirm the feasibility of an  ICT remote audit at the site (i.e. to determine if the audit objectives can be achieved using remote ICT audit  techniques) 
• a remote audit of documents, such as procedures and records 
• an on-site audit of production and storage, including any aspects of documentation which could not be audited  remotely. 
s 
e
The blended audit option is only available for the announced audit programme. 
c
i
d
n
It is not available for initial audits (i.e. the first BRCGS audit at the site, which must be completed as a full on-site  
e
p
audit); however, subsequent audits can be completed using the blended audit option. 
p
A
The significance of this audit option resides in its ability to offer flexibility in achieving the audit outcome by using  ICT to conduct the document and record review parts of the audit. 
Full details on the blended audit option are provided in the Standard (Part III, section 3).

FOOD SAFETY 
ISSUE 9 
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE 
Unannounced audits 
In this audit option all of the certification and recertification audits are unannounced (unlike the announced audit  option discussed above, where only one audit every 3 years is unannounced). 
The option to undertake the unannounced audit scheme provides companies with an opportunity to demonstrate  their confidence in their systems and procedures, to the extent that they are willing to subject these to unannounced  scrutiny. 
Companies may thereby gain a competitive advantage with their customers, who are given an opportunity to review  suppliers’ risk ratings. Customers may view suppliers in the unannounced audit scheme more favourably, depending  on performance, and they may reduce the frequency of their own customer audits as a result. 
The unannounced audit scheme is voluntary and the decision to participate in the scheme rests with the certificated  company. To opt into the scheme, companies must notify their certification body of their intention within the first 3  months following a qualifying audit; after this period only the announced scheme will be available. 
The grading criteria will be as for the normal audit. Successful completion of the audit will result in the awarding of  certification Grade AA+, A+, B+, C+ or D+, where the plus symbol indicates an unannounced audit, and this grade  will appear on the certificate. This certificate will supersede the existing certificate. 
While it may be accepted that the company would need to ensure that arrangements such as facilities to undertake  meetings and review documentation are made available at short notice, an unannounced audit should not affect  the logistics of how an audit is undertaken, and should be approached in the same way by both the auditor and the  company. The company should consider the requirements for contingency plans in the event of documents, such  as personnel records, being kept in locked cupboards and the nominated key holder being off site (e.g. through the  provision of spare keys). 
Issue 9 of the Standard provides an unannounced audit option, where all aspects of the Standard are audited on an  unannounced visit to the site. Full details of the unannounced audit scheme can be found in Part III, section 4 of the  Standard. 
Explanation of terms 
Within the Standard there are some specific terms and language used, and a good starting point for interpreting the  Standard is to be familiar with these terms and their context. A full glossary is given in Appendix 1. 
Annual frequency 
Many requirements in the Standard refer to an annual frequency for the completion of, for example, internal audits  or specific tasks. The aim of this specification is to ensure that the tasks are completed within a 12-month period  since the last occasion when the activity was completed (e.g. that the test of the system is completed every 12  months). 
Please note that there is a difference of 23 months between a test being completed in January of one year, and a  subsequent test occurring in December of the following year, which would not meet the requirement for an annual  frequency. 
Appropriate 
A number of clauses within the Standard refer to the need to fulfil requirements ‘where appropriate’. ‘Appropriate’  is defined as suitable for a particular condition or occasion, and requirements shall be met where it is an industry  requirement or it is justified to do so.

P
A number of the requirements specify appropriate timescales, appropriate personnel etc., and thus contain a level  of judgement. They are designed to provide a degree of flexibility to ensure the operation of policies or procedures  that are right for the organisation and the risks associated with the specific products. 
Documented procedures 
In many instances, the Standard specifically states that requirements shall be satisfied by documented procedures,  processes, plans or records; in others, this is implied. However, the definition in the Standard glossary (e.g.  ‘procedure’) clearly indicates that a documented system is required, as the company needs to be able to  demonstrate that systems are in place and working consistently, and that documents are available for reference  when required. 
Any policies and documents must be written in sufficient detail to satisfy their purpose and must reflect the  activities that happen in practice. 
These documents can be hard copy (i.e. paper-based) or electronic. 
Fundamental requirements 
The Standard contains certain requirements that have been designated as ‘fundamental’. These are marked with  the word ‘FUNDAMENTAL’ and denoted with the following symbol: ✰. These requirements relate to systems that  are crucial to the establishment and operation of an effective food quality and safety operation. The requirements  
I 
I
deemed fundamental are: 
 
t
r
a
P
• Senior management commitment and continual improvement (1.1) 
• The food safety plan – HACCP (2) 
• Internal audits (3.4) 
• Management of suppliers of raw materials and packaging (3.5.1) 
• Corrective and preventive actions (3.7) 
• Traceability (3.9) 
• Layout, product flow and segregation (4.3) 
• Housekeeping and hygiene (4.11) 
• Management of allergens (5.3) 
• Control of operations (6.1) 
• Labelling and pack control (6.2) 
• Training: raw-material handling, preparation, processing, packing and storage areas (7.1). 
A lack of focus on a fundamental requirement may result in certification not being granted. 
HACCP, food safety plan, prerequisites and critical control points Specific terms (such as prerequisites or critical control points) are drawn from global terminology to describe  expectations. Sites are not required to adopt the specific terminology used in the Standard. Alternative terminology  may therefore be acceptable, providing it is evident that all the requirements have been fully met. For example,  legislative requirements in the US (detailed in the Food Safety Modernization Act) use different terminology but  
s

still incorporate all the requirements of the Standard.

Risk assessment

procedures, such as establishing a frequency for monitoring a control point. The underlying principle is to  demonstrate that potential hazards have been considered by the site, and that relevant controls are applied.
brcgs.com 11 
FOOD SAFETY 
ISSUE 9 
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE 
Risk assessment is typically defined as a systematic process of identifying the hazards that may be involved in a  proposed product or process, determining their impact on food safety, authenticity, legality or quality, and designing  an appropriate control or procedure to minimise the risk of problems occurring. 
During the course of the certification audit, the auditor will require evidence of these risk assessments, including  how they were completed and evidence that the controls are justified and can stand up to robust challenge. Where  risk assessment demonstrates that further action is not required, it is important that this is also documented, with a  description of the justification. 
Risk assessments do not need to be long, complicated documents; they must, however, demonstrate that all  relevant aspects have been assessed. For example, they could be documents that identify the hazard, the risk  of its occurrence and, where appropriate, the controls used or introduced to manage the risk; alternatively, this  information may be incorporated within established procedures. 
The Standard does not prescribe a method for completing risk assessments. Sites are free to use their preferred  techniques, which may include relevant electronic or physical tools, and there are many guidelines available (for  example, the ISO 31000 Risk Management Guidelines). In many cases, industry best practice, where known and  available, will help meet this requirement. 
A risk assessment course is available from BRCGS Performance Enhancement and through the global network of  approved training providers. More information is available from the training pages on the BRCGS website. 
‘Shall’ versus ‘may’ 
The style of the Standard is generally one of guidance, to allow companies to ensure that all aspects of control  have been considered, so that thorough and comprehensive policies and procedures may be developed. In some  instances the Standard requires that criteria must be included within a policy or procedure, and this is generally  covered by the term ‘shall’. If any of the points included are not covered adequately, a non-conformity will result. 
However, there are also a number of clauses that provide examples or guidelines, generally preceded by the words  ‘may include’ or ‘should’. This information is provided as guidance for incorporation in company policies and  procedures. It is the responsibility of the company to ensure that the auditor is satisfied that the system in place is  appropriate. 
Clause 3.11.1 shows an example of both usages: 
‘The company shall have procedures designed to report and effectively manage incidents and potential emergency  situations that impact food safety, authenticity, legality or quality. This shall include consideration of contingency  plans to maintain product safety, authenticity, legality and quality. Incidents may include …’ 
Statements of intent 
Each main section or subsection of the requirements in the Standard begins with a statement of intent (SOI). This  sets out the expected outcome of compliance with the requirements of that section. This forms part of the audit  and all companies must comply with the statements of intent. Statements of intent have tinted backgrounds, as  shown here. 
Below the statements of intent in the tables are more specific and detailed requirements (clauses) that, if applied  appropriately, will help to achieve the stated objective of the requirement. All of the requirements and the  statements of intent shall form part of the audit and must be complied with in order for a certificate to be issued.

Validation 
Validation is defined as obtaining evidence that a control measure (or combination of measures), if properly  implemented, is capable of controlling a hazard to a specified outcome. Validation activity is completed before  the controls are introduced or when changes are expected (e.g. new products, new processes or new equipment).  Validation might include: 
• document and data review – previous test results, industry data, codes of practice and legislation may all contain  useful information 
• experiments/testing – consider tests on the product or factory environment that will demonstrate control (e.g.  worst-case-scenario tests, final-product tests) 
• challenge studies – for example, microbiological tests to establish whether a micro-organism of concern can grow  in the product using the relevant time/conditions 
• modelling – a number of predictive tools are available. 
Several worked examples of validation can be found in Codex guideline CXG 69-2008, available on the  Codex Alimentarius guidelines page of the FAO website. 
A validation and verification course is available from BRCGS Performance Enhancement and through the global  network of approved training providers. More information is available from the BRCGS website.

within the correct parameters. Verification requires the application of methods, procedures, tests or evaluations, in  addition to monitoring, to determine whether the control measure is operating as intended. Verification activities  may include: 
• audits – both internal and third-party 
• review of records (e.g. records of the monitoring of temperatures and times, or other records completed during  production) to confirm results were within expected limits and consider any trends 
• corrective action review 
• test results – depending on the control being verified, these might include final products, raw materials, swabs,  rapid tests, etc. 
A validation and verification course is available from BRCGS Performance Enhancement and through the global  network of approved training providers. More information is available from the BRCGS website. 
Monitoring 
Monitoring is defined as conducting a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether a  control measure is within acceptable limits (e.g. temperature checks, metal detector checks, test weights).

Guidance on the requirements 
1 Senior management commitment 
1.1 Senior management commitment and continual improvement 
Fundamental 
The site’s senior management shall demonstrate that they are fully committed to the  
implementation of the requirements of the Global Standard Food Safety and to processes which  facilitate continual improvement of food safety, quality management, and the site’s food safety and  quality culture. 
Interpretation 
A fundamental factor in the management of product safety is the product safety and quality culture which prevails at  the site; that is, the shared attitudes, values and beliefs relating to the importance of product safety, the confidence  in the product safety processes used at the site, and the systems available to report and act on any concerns relating  
I 
I
 
to product safety. 
t
r
a
P
For this culture to flourish and for the importance of product safety to be understood by all members of staff, it is  vital that product safety is led from the top of the organisation. This includes not only the official company policies  and procedures, the KPIs or targets the company challenges itself to meet, but also the culture which prevails and  the direction the company takes. This leadership should also ensure that the necessary commitment, support and  resources are available. 
Without this culture and management commitment, it is very unlikely that the Standard could be consistently  applied or that the customer assurance provided by certification could be honoured. There are requirements within  the Standard that need to be understood and applied by most functions within the organisation, from purchasing  to personnel and from maintenance to production. Experience has shown that only where the most senior  management are committed to the processes can this level of involvement be achieved consistently. Leadership  behaviours, tendencies and management practices all influence the culture of safety, increasing the likelihood of the  site adhering to good practice. 
Senior managers should therefore be fully engaged in the implementation of and ongoing compliance with the  Standard. 
Continual improvement is also an important principle of the Standard. This is not a question of how many non conformities the site received in consecutive audits, although if the same non-conformity repeatedly occurred at  every audit, that may indicate a wider concern. Continual improvement asks whether the company uses ongoing  s 
opportunities to improve relevant aspects of its ways of working. There are many clauses within the Standard that  
e
c
i
point towards this principle and provide these opportunities. For example: 
d
n
e
• Plans to develop and continually improve product safety and quality culture of the organisation (see clause 1.1.2) 
p
p
• Review processes and meetings – for example, senior leadership management meetings (see clause 1.1.4) A
• Data capture and trending – for example, the trending of complaints information, so that significant negative  trends can be investigated and improvements made (see clause 3.10.2) 
• Processes for remaining up to date with emerging issues, legislation and good practice (see clause 1.1.8) • The role of preventive action (see clause 1.1.12 and the clauses within section 3.7).

Clause 
	Requirements
	1.1.1 
	The site shall have a documented policy which states the site’s intention to meet its  obligation to produce safe, legal and authentic products to the specified quality, and its  responsibility to its customers. This shall: 
• be signed by the person with overall responsibility for the site 
• be communicated to all staff 
• include commitment to continuously improve the site’s food safety and quality culture.
	



Interpretation Documented policy 
The site’s policy must clearly state the overall aims to meet customer requirements,  
including the provision of safe, authentic products of the quality desired by the customer.  The policy will also highlight the site’s intention to improve product safety and quality  culture on a continuous basis, which, as discussed (for example, in the interpretation for  the statement of intent and importantly in clause 1.1.2), is fundamental in the consistent  application of product safety practices. The policy is designed to show the site’s intention,  so that all staff can work towards this common goal. 
Authenticity of products means ensuring that all products sold or purchased are of  
the nature, substance and quality expected. This applies not just to product claims, but  includes all products and raw materials with the assurance that they meet the specification.  Authenticity is defined in the glossary. 
The policy must be signed by the person with overall responsibility for the audited site,  to demonstrate the commitment at senior management at site level. Where the policy is a  group- or company-wide statement, the site management should endorse it; for example, by  countersigning it. 
The policy statement is only a summary and can usually be expressed in a single page.  Although it does not need to be dated, it must be current and should therefore be updated  when significant policies or senior management change. The policy forms the foundation  for the site’s ways of working and the auditor will expect to see how the site management  ensure staff understanding and engagement. This may include: 
• communication to staff (e.g. through display on noticeboards, inclusion in the induction  process, availability on the company intranet, and the use of appropriate languages where  the local language is not the first language of all employees. The use of dual languages  may improve and speed up understanding and action) 
• inclusion of all staff, including temporary and contract staff, in the communication and  engagement processes.

Interpretation Food safety and quality culture 
t
r
a
Analysis of the root causes of many non-conformities shows that a proactive, positive  
P
product safety and quality culture (hereafter referred to as culture) within a company can  
make all the difference in the effectiveness of the food safety and quality plan and its  
consistent implementation throughout the site. Culture must be led by senior management  
and ‘felt’ throughout the organisation, so that all aspects of the business are informed and  
involved. It is important to understand that the culture plan is unlikely to be successful if  
it is viewed as simply a technical function. It will require the input and commitment of the  
site’s senior leadership team and may also align with several teams around the business; for  
example, with human resources (HR) or personnel management activities. 
Culture can be challenging. It relies not just on measurables and specifics but an ethos and  
values felt by people at all levels of the site. The size and complexity (or simplicity) of the  
site should not be a barrier to a successful culture. 
The site is required to develop, implement and maintain a clear plan or programme for  
developing and improving its culture. Such a plan should be based on the nature of the  
organisation, and dependent on its size, seasonality and the overall aims it has identified  
as important for its own culture. The clause does not prescribe the exact mechanisms that  
must be used; this is to allow the site flexibility to develop systems that are effective within  
its specific ways of working, and its current prevailing culture. It does, however, highlight the  
minimum scope of the plan. 
s 
The plan will need to consider the measures needed to achieve the intended positive

culture change.

Interpretation  continued 
The plan does not need to be annual. A strategic plan could, for example, cover 5 years, with  activities designed to measure current culture, implement changes and assess improvements  (or where improvement was not evident, a review of why). Some aspects of the plan may  occur more frequently than others. However, for the plan to be effective, the development  and improvement of culture will need to be treated as an ongoing and continuous process,  and the auditor will expect to see evidence that activities are being completed each year  during which the plan is designed to operate. It is not acceptable to design a 5-year plan  where all of the activities are completed within the final year. 
Regardless of the intended length or lifetime of the plan, it is important that it remains  relevant and up to date. The site will therefore need to ensure that it is regularly reviewed  and updated. At a minimum there must be an annual review. 
A wide range of activities could be incorporated into a culture development plan, some of  which the company may already be conducting. As a minimum the Standard requires: 
• a clear and open communication on product safety 
• training 
• feedback from employees 
• behaviour changes required to maintain and improve product safety processes • performance measurement on product safety, authenticity, legality and quality related  activities. 
However, note that culture is not simply a matter of introducing another policy, but on  developing attitudes and a positive approach to product safety and product safety processes.  For example: 
• Ease of movement of product safety information between different levels and sections of  the site can be an indication of a good culture. However, a formal communication policy is  not likely to affect company culture, unless the site has considered what is communicated,  in what format. For example, if all communication is finance-related and lacks information  on product safety, then staff may mistakenly believe that product safety is not important,  due to its lack of communication. Instead, regular, open and clear communication,  involving all personnel, is needed, including expectations, benefits, product safety  successes as well as deviations from what is expected or acceptable. 
• Training and staff development (e.g. the use of annual staff reviews and one-to-ones)  should have a number of aims beyond just training the process or procedure (e.g.  awareness of food safety issues, management techniques, and development of positive  behaviours and staff development). 
• Feedback from employees (e.g. staff surveys), focusing on values and culture, can provide  useful information on current mindset and culture, impact of recent initiatives and  preferred direction of travel. Feedback mechanisms also provide an opportunity to identify  and address staff concerns.

Interpretation • Consideration of the behaviour changes needed to improve culture – the site should  choose relevant behaviours that will have a positive impact on product safety. These  
relevant behaviours may be identified simply by a manager’s knowledge of the site, or  
identified through the results of a site survey (such as the BRCGS Culture Excellence  
Module), or by considering the many indicators (or artefacts) of the behaviours, beliefs or  
attitudes that exist at a site. These can provide an indication of the prevailing culture and  
could be used in this part of the plan. An artefact of culture is described as an existing  
product safety activity that is not culture itself, but is indicative of the site’s prevailing  
culture (i.e. the site’s attitudes towards the value or importance of a specific product  
safety activity, and its compliance with that activity, is often indicative of the culture of  
the site). These behaviours or attitudes are often identifiable by the site and useful in  
the maintenance and improvement of product safety culture and can therefore be built  
into the culture improvement plan. Many fundamental product safety processes could be  
considered artefacts of the culture; for example: 
• food safety policy 
• objective setting and management review 
• food safety in management meetings 
• food safety resources 
I 
I
• risk awareness (e.g. for HACCP development) 
 
t
r
• effectiveness of corrective and preventive actions 
a
P
• internal audits 
• training. 
Remember that these activities are not the culture themselves; they are artefacts –  
indicators of the prevalent product safety behaviours at the site. 
• Performance measurement – this is different from clause 1.1.3. There, the objectives are  
used to directly improve food safety, whereas the aim of this clause is to consider the  
impact of the results and learnings on product safety culture. For example, if an objective  
is always met, or always missed, or the objective remains unchanged every year, this may  
indicate a site attitude towards the objectives and provides site leadership with an attitude  
to focus on. In other words, is the site attitude to develop and continuously improve food  
safety using the objectives as one of the tools, or are the objectives set only to meet the  
requirements of the Standard? 
Along with the activities, the culture plan must also include information indicating how  
activities will be undertaken, the intended timescales for completion, plans for measurement  
(including results from previous activities) and a review of the effectiveness of completed  
activities. 
This information should be used to review the plan to ensure it remains up to date and  
relevant for the site. It also has the bonus of creating a history of improvements and impacts.  
This information can be used, for example, to train new employees, inspire existing staff and  
s 
further inform the types of activity/implementation that are most effective at the site and  
e
c
those which are more likely to struggle.

Culture is often considered to be subjective and therefore difficult to audit. It must be

p
emphasised that auditors are not expected to audit ‘food safety culture’ of the site, but the  
p
evidence of compliance with the requirements of the clause. The auditor will therefore  
A
examine evidence of conformity with this requirement during both the audit of the facilities  
and the documentation audit. This will be achieved using a number of auditing techniques;

• a review of the documented plan and records – is it complete, does it contain all the  relevant information, how were the activities and objectives set, are the monitoring and  review processes operating correctly and have they been used to review and update the  plan to ensure it remains relevant for the site? 
• discussion with senior management on the development and implementation of the plan  (refer to clause 1.1.11). 
• discussions may be conducted across all levels of personnel on an informal basis. The  auditor would expect to find an awareness of food safety culture, how individuals can  impact it, and the company’s objectives. 
• evidence of the site completing the activities in its action plan. 
• timescales and evidence that they have been met. 
• monitoring and review processes, and results from previous activities. 
BRCGS provides a number of services that can support a site’s development of its culture  plan, including: 
• an additional voluntary module in product safety culture excellence which helps sites  measure the current culture and identify areas for improvement. 
• a guideline on product safety culture which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or  viewed online at BRCGS Participate. 
• a training course explaining culture and its implementation. 
Non-conformities To ensure expectations are understood relating to compliance with clause 1.1.2, its consistent  application at certificated sites, and assessment during audits, BRCGS has trained auditors  and certification bodies to apply the following non-conformities, where sites are non 
compliant: 
• Major non-conformity Where the site does not have a documented plan for food safety  and quality culture. In this context a plan is more than a short statement of intent, but is  documentation incorporating all of the requirements of the clause. 
• Minor non-conformity Where a documented plan exists, but: 
• is of poor quality (e.g. lacks detail such as timescales for completion or clear action  
plans) 
• does not cover all the relevant areas or staff 
• is not fully implemented (e.g. some activities are not implemented or are not completed  to a predefined schedule). 
The final bullet point in the clause requires sites to undertake a review of the effectiveness  of completed activities. However, it is possible that this review of the success of the  
programme would not always be implemented in year 1 (since a review cannot be completed  until there are activities to review). Therefore non-compliance with this bullet point is not  considered a non-conformity at the site’s initial audit, but will be assessed from the site’s  second audit to the Standard onwards. 
The site is expected to complete corrective action, root cause analysis and preventive action  plans in accordance with section 2.3 of the audit protocol prior to certification, and any non conformity will be included in the calculation of the site’s grade.

Example Food safety and quality culture plan 
The company decides to implement a culture plan. Based on the requirements of the  
Standard it identifies six key areas to include: 
• Enhanced training Beyond just managing critical control points (CCPs), to an  
understanding of the reasons for the current product safety processes and involving staff  
in corrective actions. 
• Communications Regular staff updates in addition to the traditional internal message  
boards. Updates are used to communicate production, incidences of non-conforming  
product, customer complaints and their corrective actions, and improvements in product  
quality. They also focus on company strategy and product safety objectives. 
• A clear feedback process To initiate communication ‘up’ to management, so that  
communication is not seen just as management ‘telling staff’. 
• Recognition Management instigates ‘employee of the month’ awards as rewards for  
successful process improvement ideas. 
• Behaviours to maintain and improve product safety The site identifies two areas it would  
like to focus on: 
• Previously the site had developed reporting and whistleblowing systems which allow  
I 
staff to feed back concerns relating to product safety, in accordance with clauses 1.1.6  
I
 
t
r
and 1.2.3 of the Standard. However, staff feedback has identified a lack of use of the  
a
systems due to: 
P
• a lack of encouragement to report errors and product safety concerns 
• a lack of trust, and a feeling that it is not safe or comfortable to report problems 
• a belief that problems will not be taken seriously or that nothing will improve. 
Senior management therefore decides to include staff reporting and concerns about  
the current system in the culture improvement plan, and look for ways to build trust and  
encourage use. 
• Internal audits are an extremely useful site-based tool for monitoring and improving  
systems. However, the site notices that many departments undervalue the audit  
programme, with several reports reflecting a negative attitude towards the programme.  
Senior management also notes that internal audits require effort and resource to  
complete robustly and effectively, which have not always been available. In fact, at a  
previous management meeting the senior leadership had considered the potential to  
further minimise the internal audit programme (e.g. by resorting to tick-box exercises,  
reducing the number of audits or auditors, and completing the minimum activity  
possible, rather than reviewing the actual risks). 
The culture plan therefore includes activities to build belief in, and use of, the internal  
audit programme, starting with education about the programme and its importance,  
training for new internal auditors, communication of audit results (positives as well as  
non-conformity), using the management review programme to consider learnings from  
s 
the programme which can further benefit the site.

To ensure that the activities proceed according to the plan (and in accordance with the  Standard), the site management: 
• assigns timescales for the start of each activity 
• nominates leaders for each activity with responsibility to lead the activities identified • makes progress against the product safety culture plan an agenda item at the quarterly  senior management team meetings 
• schedules a follow-up staff survey for 12 months’ time which will specifically be used to  assess the effectiveness of the planned activities 
• sets a review date for the complete plan. 
The site’s senior management shall ensure that clear objectives are defined to maintain  and improve the safety, authenticity, legality and quality of products manufactured, in  accordance with the food safety and quality policy and this Standard. These objectives shall  be: 
• documented and include targets or clear measures of success 
• clearly communicated to all staff 
• monitored and results reported at least quarterly to site senior management and all staff. 
Interpretation Food safety and quality objectives 
Senior management must set objectives concerning food safety, authenticity, legality and  quality that help to achieve the stated policy (see clause 1.1.1). 
The objectives must be communicated so that staff understand what is required from  them. The setting of these objectives also helps the allocation of suitable budgets and  resources. Auditors will look for evidence that the objectives are in place and have been  communicated. 
Good objectives are usually: 
• Specific Objectives should be clear and directly related to the site’s aims or goals for  product safety and quality. 
• Measurable Objectives should be measurable so that the site can assess progress. 
• Achievable Targets that stretch the company are acceptable but it is important that they  are realistic and that sufficient resources will be available. 
• Relevant Objectives should be designed to maintain and improve product safety and  quality. 
• Time-bound Objectives can be long-term (e.g. throughout the period of certification) or  shorter-term (e.g. within the next 3 months); however, the timescales or deadlines should  be clear to enable the site to review progress and, if necessary, amend activities. 
There are many examples of objectives that could be included. For example: 
• reductions in customer complaints, non-conforming products and/or customer rejections  or returns 
• reductions in audit failures or audit non-conformities – include both internal and external  audits, but ensure that all audits are still completed to a thorough, rigorous quality 
• improved product safety training 
• improvements to the management of product authenticity 
• increases to product testing.

In each of these examples it would be necessary for the site to consider how to make the  objective specific and measurable (as discussed above); for example, 10% fewer customer  complaints to be achieved by year end. 
Objectives associated with product authenticity are likely to be formed differently; for  example, they may be linked to: 
• improvements to the traceability systems or traceability testing (section 3.9) • evolution of product monitoring processes such as product testing (section 5.6) • outcomes from the vulnerability assessment (section 5.4) 
• updates to the supplier approval mechanisms and the ongoing monitoring of suppliers  (section 3.5). 
A similar situation exists for objectives associated with legality, as these will also need to be  formed differently from those commonly used for product safety. For example, where there  is proposed legislation in the region where the company operates, then possible targets may  relate to ensuring that relevant staff are trained in a timely manner. 
Progress against targets must be reviewed and reported to senior management at least  quarterly. It may, for example, be included in management meetings (e.g. those scheduled  I 
for clause 1.1.4), or it may be the subject of a separate review or included in a report to  
I
 
t
management. Auditors will look for documented evidence of communication and the  
r
a
quarterly progress review. 
P
The Standard also requires communication to staff (including all employees and agency supplied staff). The Standard is not prescriptive on the methods of communication used  to meet this clause. For example, any of the following could be used: meetings, briefings,  cascades, huddles, electronic media (e.g. email), and company noticeboards. 
Independent sites or facilities that are part of a large group with company-wide objectives  can adopt the company-wide objectives, but are required to ‘own’ the objectives and carry  out the implementation, monitoring, review etc. at site level. 
Management review meetings attended by the site’s senior management shall be undertaken  at appropriate planned intervals, annually at a minimum, to review the site performance  against the Standard and objectives set in clause 1.1.3. The review process shall include the  evaluation of: 
• previous management review action plans and timeframes 
• the results of internal, second-party and/or third-party audits 
• any objectives that have not been met, to understand the underlying reasons. This  information shall be used when setting future objectives and to facilitate continual  improvement

Interpretation Senior management review 
The purpose of the management review meeting is to take an overview of the food safety  systems. It should therefore be a full and detailed examination of what has happened and  what should happen in future. It is not the ongoing management of an issue or concern  (although the agenda may include a review of any such concerns) and it is not just incident/ non-conforming product management (processes for these activities are covered in the  relevant sections of the Standard; for example, in sections 3.8 and 3.11). 
The format of the meeting should reflect company size. 
The Standard identifies specific agenda items that must be included within the meeting;  however, additional relevant subjects should also be included where appropriate. As a  minimum the meeting agenda should therefore consider: 
• minutes of the previous management reviews and actions agreed. For example, the  
previous meeting may have set actions and timescales for their completion; however,  
if actions were not completed on schedule or have failed to be effective, further  
investigation and actions will be required 
• what has been achieved or not been achieved and progress against objectives (see  
clause 1.1.3); for example: 
• if an objective has been met the site can consider future targets based on achievements  to date 
• if an objective has not been met the site can consider why. This can be very informative  and allows future objectives (or other actions such as the product safety culture plan)  to focus on areas where relevant, achievable actions can take place. This review need  
not be exhaustive (such as a full root cause analysis) but the site should be able to  
understand why objectives were not met. The outcome would not be preventive action  but continual improvement, allowing the site to refine its future targets 
• internal, second-party and/or third-party audits, and subsequent actions. As a minimum  the Standard requires a summary of the results from the internal audit programme to be  reviewed at these meetings (see clause 3.4.3). This provides two opportunities for the  
senior management team: 
• a review of non-conformities, corrective actions, root causes and preventive actions,  with a focus on any outstanding concerns or additional actions required (individual  
issues should have been identified and acted upon at the time they were identified and  where necessary, escalated to the management team during the year) 
• review of the overall performance and key trends should facilitate continuous  
improvement (e.g. changes to the frequency of auditing particular areas, training needs or  suggestions for improvements or further developments of the internal audit programme) Similarly, second- or third-party activities (including customer audits, regulatory authority  visits) could be summarised to facilitate further discussion and identify any actions or  improvements that need to be made 
• progress against the product safety and quality culture plan and the effectiveness of  completed actions 
• product safety incidents, complaints, out-of-specification results or non-conforming  products, to ensure these have been fully actioned, to assess any trends and identify any  additional follow-up actions or improvements needed as a result of these incidents and  non-conforming situations 
• the management and effectiveness of product safety systems such as HACCP, food  
defence and product authenticity, along with any existing or emerging issues relating to  these topics

It is important that sufficient information is presented to the meeting to enable a full and  meaningful discussion and, where appropriate, actions to be agreed. 
Senior management is considered to consist of managers who have the authority to  make decisions on food safety objectives and/or the provision of adequate human and  financial resources. The management team would usually include the site manager and  those managers responsible for production, technical operations, purchasing, engineering  and human resources. For large, multi-site organisations the management review meeting  may include head office representatives, but this decision should be driven by the senior  management on site. It may also include representatives from any departments responsible  for specific product safety activities or for specific agenda items. 
Good practice is to ensure that the meeting is put into all attendees’ diaries sufficiently early  to maximise attendance and that agendas and papers are circulated in advance. 
The auditor will be looking for evidence that, for each agenda item, sufficient information  has been provided to allow an informed discussion to take place leading to appropriate  
I 
I
 
action plans. This may be demonstrated through a review of the inputs to the meeting,  
t
r
a
minutes of the discussion of the items and, where necessary, agreed action plans. To  P
demonstrate that, for example, senior management has reviewed the management of the  HACCP system, the minutes should contain a general summary of the HACCP review  meeting (see section 2.12.3) and a record of its outcomes (these would be inputs into  the management review meeting), together with any actions requested during the senior  management meeting (i.e. outputs of management review meeting). 
One of the outputs from the meeting is a review of performance against the objectives  (clause 1.1.3) and the establishment of new or amended targets and objectives for the  following year. This should be clearly documented within the minutes of the meeting. 
The outcomes from the review meeting must be communicated to the relevant staff to  ensure implementation. It should be evident to the auditor how this has been achieved  (e.g. cascaded through staff briefings or posted on noticeboards). It should also be evident  that actions are followed up and completed. For example, evidence of completion could  be added to meeting records, or assessment of actions could be added to the internal audit  programme. 
The Standard requires an annual review, such as a regular annual management review  meeting. However, it is important that meetings are scheduled correctly and of sufficient  frequency to maximise the value of the meeting and allow timely actions. Many companies  opt to make a review or partial review more frequently (e.g. every 6 months or each quarter),  
s 
either addressing all the points in summary (after other review meetings) or addressing  e
one or two points in depth in each meeting. The number of meetings and the individual  
c
i
d
agendas should be based on company need, providing all relevant topics are covered within  n
e
the 12-month period. Where meetings are scheduled with a large intervening period (e.g.  p
annually) the site needs a process to ensure that any matters needing consideration can

be completed in a timely fashion; for example, by incorporating them into management  meeting agendas (see clause 1.1.5).

Special consideration should be given to seasonal and temporary sites to ensure meetings  occur at an appropriate point in the season and that actions, targets or objectives can be  completed. Some sites therefore opt for two meetings; for example, one at the start of the  season, to allow objective setting, and one at the end of the season, when the season’s  information can be assessed. Alternatively, a management meeting shortly after an external  audit allows any non-conformities to be included in the discussion and relevant corrective  actions to be agreed. 
All sites should have a predefined schedule so all participants are aware, in advance, of when  the meetings will take place. 
The site shall have a demonstrable meeting programme which enables food safety,  authenticity, legality and quality issues to be brought to the attention of senior management.  These meetings shall occur at least monthly. 
Interpretation Management meetings 
The objective of this clause is to ensure that there is a mechanism that enables the site to  learn and react to available information from both internal (within the site and/or company)  and external sources (e.g. wider industry, media, etc), allowing food safety, authenticity,  legality and quality issues to be raised and discussed at a senior management level within  the site. The meeting could include, for example: 
• review of successes/failures relating to product safety, authenticity, legality and quality and  the lessons that can be learnt from these 
• any ongoing concerns 
• review of corrective actions, root causes, preventive actions and the effectiveness of these • review of information relating to publications, known recalls of similar products,  
information from regulatory authorities, media stories and potential implications/learnings  for the site. This could include information obtained as a result of activities to comply with  clause 1.1.8 
• overview of KPIs, complaint levels or other relevant metrics. 
Meetings will need to include management of a seniority to make decisions, and where  appropriate, take actions. 
Most sites have weekly or monthly management meetings and the inclusion of safety,  authenticity, legality and quality as an agenda item within this meeting is one way to meet  the requirements of this clause. 
A schedule for the meetings needs to be in place. 
Seasonal sites are not expected to have monthly meetings when the site is closed and not  operating, but scheduling should consider the length of the season and processes to ensure  that food safety, authenticity, legality and quality issues can be discussed in a timely manner.  For example, the first meeting could take place shortly before the season begins, with further  meetings monthly or even weekly throughout the season, and a final meeting at the end of  the season. 
The audit will confirm whether: 
• the meetings occur at a defined frequency (e.g. a schedule, diary bookings or agendas) • previous meetings contained relevant discussions (e.g. agenda and minutes for the  
meetings which clearly state conclusions and any additional actions).

1.1.6 
	



Good practice is to ensure that any decisions and actions agreed are communicated to  appropriate staff, and that there is a system to check that actions are implemented within  agreed timescales. 
The company shall have a confidential reporting system to enable staff to report concerns  relating to product safety, authenticity, legality and quality. 
The mechanism (e.g. the relevant telephone number) for reporting concerns shall be clearly  communicated to staff. 
The company’s senior management shall have a process for assessing any concerns raised.  Records of the assessment and, where appropriate, actions taken, shall be documented. 
Interpretation Confidential reporting system (whistleblowing) 
In 2018 a report from the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners found that reports  
from employees and outside parties are by far the most common method of detecting  
wrongdoing. It is therefore vital that all sites facilitate effective communication methods  
allowing staff to report any concerns. Ideally, this will be achievable using procedures  
I 
I
developed to meet clause 1.2.3. However, from time to time it may be necessary for  
 
t
r
individuals to report on hazards or infractions anonymously and confidentially (e.g. if a  
a
P
staff member felt that a genuine concern raised through other mechanisms, such as those  
covered in clause 1.2.3, had not been adequately addressed), so the site (or company) should  
have a system in place to manage this. Although the aim of the Standard is to ensure these  
reporting systems relate to product safety, authenticity, quality and legality, the company  
may choose to incorporate all staff concerns into the system, and not limit it to concerns  
related to the scope of the Standard. 
As a minimum, the system used must ensure that the confidentiality of the employee  
reporting the concern is maintained (i.e. the employee’s identity is not known or released  
to the site or company management) to protect any staff using it, and the confidential and  
anonymous nature of the system should be clear to all staff. An email or telephone call to an  on-site manager, for example, is unlikely to be anonymous or confidential as the manager is  
likely to know the employee’s email address or recognise their voice. Therefore this would  
not be considered a confidential system. 
Many food processors will also have whistleblowing systems established by the brand  
owners and retailers for which it produces. Where this is the case, the site is still required  
to have its own system as affected products may not relate to the specific brand owner.  
Additionally, in some areas, local relevant regulatory authorities will have facilities for  
confidential reports about a site but this also does not mitigate the need for a site (or  
company) to have a system. 
s 
e
As well as gathering information, the site is required to collate and act on it. The auditor

will expect to see a system in place, and transparency about the content of any reports and  
d

actions, although not the source of the original concern.

Where possible, sites might consider an independent system that receives and processes

any concerns raised with appropriate promptness. For example, where quality, safety or

independent consultant or a professional organisation that can act as an intermediary.

Interpretation

Where local legal requirements prohibit certain activities around confidentiality or such  reports, the site will need to ensure the system employed meets these legal requirements.  This will also be acknowledged by the auditor and compliance with this clause noted within  the context of the legal framework. 
It is not uncommon for larger companies to base the management of their confidential  reporting systems at head office, rather than at each individual site. This is acceptable and  the audit process is explained in Appendix 4 of the Standard. 
BRCGS operates the independent ‘Tell BRCGS’ facility (available online). This has been  designed so that BRCGS can receive information from any interested party about the status  of certificated sites or the certification process. Therefore, when feedback is received, it will  be investigated and this may, for example, identify the need for a compliance audit at the  implicated site to ensure that it is operating legally and in compliance with the Standard.  This is different from the aim of this whistleblowing clause, which is to provide the site/ company management with an opportunity to receive and address any concerns raised  by employees without the site being subject to an external review. Therefore, a site using  the Tell BRCGS system without its own confidential reporting system will not achieve the  intended aim of the clause, although it could be used for situations where an employee has  tried other site-specific options and is still sufficiently concerned to raise the matter with  BRCGS. 
The company’s senior management shall provide the human and financial resources required  to produce safe, authentic, legal products to the specified quality and in compliance with the  requirements of this Standard. 
Interpretation Resources 
Sites must have sufficient financial and human resources to be able to maintain the food  safety, authenticity, legality and quality systems. 
Although a review of resources forms part of the management review process (clause 1.1.4),  it should not be restricted to a single annual discussion if there is a need to make changes to  resource allocation during the course of the year. 
As well as looking at the minutes of the management review meeting, auditors will also  look at the type, number and root causes of non-conformities identified at the audit, as the  ability of the site to meet the requirements of the Standard will partly demonstrate that the  appropriate resources and skills are available. 
The auditor will examine this requirement during both the audit of the facilities and  
documentation. The auditor will expect the site to demonstrate that it is adequately  
resourcing its product safety, authenticity, legality and quality activities, which may include  capital expenditure (e.g. for repairs or new equipment), staff levels and staff training. 


1.1.8 
	



The company’s senior management shall have a system in place to ensure that the site is  kept informed of and reviews: 
• scientific and technical developments 
• industry codes of practice 
• new risks to authenticity of raw materials 
• all relevant legislation in the country where the product will be sold (where known).

Interpretation Technical knowledge and information 
Food safety issues and legislative requirements are constantly changing. The objective of  
this clause is to ensure that sites remain up to date, are able to meet legislation and can  
adapt their food safety systems to protect against new threats. The company must be able  
to demonstrate that it maintains up-to-date knowledge of relevant legislation, scientific and  
technical developments, potential risks to raw materials (e.g. to the authenticity of the raw  
material) and industry codes of practice, such as Codex Alimentarius. Activities to achieve  
this may include: 
• membership of a trade association that provides this service 
• subscription to a service provider supplying legal updates 
• help from government officials or local enforcement offices 
• regular review of identified websites covering legislation and standards. 
In addition to information relating to food safety, the site must also have a system to obtain  
and review information relating to the authenticity of raw materials and the potential for  
substitution or dilution of the ingredients. This information will, for example, be required to  
demonstrate compliance with clause 5.4.2. 
I 
The company needs to demonstrate that it can readily access, either directly or through  
I
 
t
a third party, legislation relating to the product in the country, state or territory where the  
r
a
product is sold to the ultimate consumer (if known, or where it can reasonably be expected  
P
to be sold). Good practice is also to consider the country where the product is manufactured. 
The auditor will therefore look for evidence of systematic checking and of the process for  
ensuring the information is transferred into action as necessary. 


1.1.9 
	



The site shall have a genuine, original hard copy or electronic version of the current  Standard available and be aware of any changes to the Standard or protocol that are  published on the BRCGS website. 
Interpretation Availability of a copy of the Standard 
The aim of this clause is to ensure the site has easy access to all the relevant requirements  
for compliance and certification to the Standard. The site must therefore have an official  
copy of the Standard available in either paper or electronic form. Either a free or paid-for  
PDF copy of the Standard demonstrates compliance with this requirement. A subscription to  BRCGS Participate provides an online version of the Standard (and interpretation and other  
guidelines) and therefore also meets this requirement. 
The site will also need copies of any additional voluntary modules to which they are  
certificated.

Published TAC opinions are defined as ‘position statements’. Position statements are binding  on the way that the audit and certification process is carried out and are considered to  be an extension to the Standard. Sites must therefore be aware of any published position  statements and, where necessary, ensure the information is transferred into action. Position  statements are published on the ‘Food Safety Help and Guidance’ page of the BRCGS  website and available on BRCGS Participate. They are communicated via the BRCGS  newsletter. This newsletter is sent to all certificated companies. Position statements are also  communicated to certification bodies via the bulletin. 
Where the site is certificated to the Standard, it shall ensure that announced or blended  announced recertification audits occur on or before the audit due date indicated on the  certificate. 
Interpretation Audit due dates 
The audit due date is indicated on both the audit report and the certificate issued to all  certificated sites. The responsibility for scheduling the next audit rests with the site. 
Announced audits may be taken in the 28 calendar days up to and including the audit due  date. Blended audits may commence within the 56 calendar days prior to the audit due date. 
Late audits are likely to result in a gap in certification and a major non-conformity will be  awarded unless exceptional circumstances occur as identified in the audit protocol section  of the Standard (Part III, section 2.7.2). This includes situations where the site is: 
• situated in a specific country, or an area within a specific country, where there is  
government advice not to visit and there is no suitable local auditor 
• within a statutory exclusion zone that could compromise food safety or animal welfare • in an area that has suffered a natural or unnatural disaster, rendering the site unable to  produce or the auditor unable to visit 
• affected by conditions that do not allow access to the site or restrict travel (e.g. heavy  snow) 
• producing seasonal products where production is delayed by a late start to the seasons  (e.g. due to weather or product availability). 
Lack of personnel is not an acceptable reason for adjusting the audit date. It is expected that  the site will appoint adequate deputies and established systems of working to ensure the  smooth operation of the site in the absence of individual managers. Nor is the undertaking  of building work an acceptable reason for delay unless the site is not in production while the  building work is carried out. 
Where a site has an unannounced audit, either by opting into the voluntary unannounced  scheme or due to the requirement for a mandatory unannounced audit, it becomes the  responsibility of the certification body to ensure this requirement is met. 


1.1.11 
	

	



The most senior production or operations manager on site shall participate in the opening  and closing meetings of the audit for certification to the Standard.

Interpretation Senior management attendance at the audit 
For a site to successfully complete a BRCGS audit, it will be necessary to involve a range of  
different site colleagues, including senior managers, section heads and staff responsible for  
completing specific activities. Involving a range of site colleagues in this way has a number  
of advantages, including: 
• It allows the individuals that are responsible for, or who complete, specific activities to  
explain them and discuss any questions the auditor may have, ensuring that the auditor  
receives detailed, up-to-date information, and can observe the activity in action. 
• It allows members of the team who are not currently needed for the audit to complete  
other duties, either as part of their normal work or preparation for other parts of the audit;  
for example, compiling the information for the vertical audit. 
• It indicates a positive product safety culture, where management encourages staff of all  
levels to be involved in the audit process. 
As a minimum the most senior production or operations managers on site (i.e. those who  
are responsible for the hands-on, daily running of the site) must participate in the opening  
and closing meetings of the audit. The objective is to ensure that non-conformities are  
effectively understood and agreed; therefore this site representative will need to be  
I 
I
 
sufficiently senior to make decisions regarding any non-conformities and the corrective  
t
r
a
action to be taken. 
P
The auditor will also need to discuss food safety and quality culture and the site’s  
implementation of its plan to improve the culture with this manager or an appropriate  
member of the senior management team. 
It may be the case that the most senior operations managers within the company are  
absent on the day of the audit because of other commitments, especially where an audit is  
unannounced; however, there must always be a nominated deputy available (clause 1.2.1). 


1.1.12 
	

	



The site’s senior management shall ensure that the root causes of any non-conformities  against the Standard identified at the previous audit have been effectively addressed to  prevent recurrence. 
Interpretation Recurring non-conformities 
An important aspect of the Standard is to encourage continual improvement of product  
safety processes (e.g. see the statement of intent for section 1.1) and the prevention of non 
conforming situations is one aspect of this. Therefore, non-conformities identified in the  
previous certification audit must have been fully and effectively rectified (i.e. corrective and  
preventive actions completed) and these will be checked during the current audit. Therefore,  for each non-conformity at the last audit, the auditor will expect to see: 
s 
e
• Corrective action The site will have completed its corrective action within 28 days of the  
c
i
last audit. The auditor will therefore expect to see this action in operation (e.g. that the  
d
n
updated procedure submitted to the certification body as evidence of corrective action is  
e
p
in use, or that repairs have been completed and remain effective).

• Preventive action At the time when the certificate was awarded, the site will have  submitted a preventive action plan, but may not have completed all of the preventive  action. The auditor will therefore expect to see evidence that the site implemented  preventive action and that recurrence of the non-conformity has therefore been  effectively prevented. 
• Root cause analysis Root cause analysis is used to identify the fundamental or root cause  of a non-conformity, and is therefore a key activity in establishing appropriate preventive  action. Although the site submitted the root cause analysis following the previous audit,  
the auditor may need to review this; for example, if preventive action has been ineffective  at preventing the non-conformity. 
This process is detailed in Part III of the Standard, section 2.3.2. 
Many sites have found it useful to retain copies of records and documents implicated by  non-conformities with the audit records. This allows quick and easy reference to the specific  document while reviewing, investigating and correcting the non-conformity. (The original  copy of the document, should, of course, be returned to the appropriate place in the site’s  quality system.) 
Note that additional information on preventive action and root cause analysis, and non conforming situations which require their use, is detailed in Part II, section 3.7 of the  Standard, and especially clause 3.7.2. 
A site’s attitude towards preventive action may also indicate its product safety culture. For  example, minimal follow-up, or preventive action that is just seen as a necessary document  to pass an audit, may be a sign of a poor culture. 
BRCGS has published a guideline to understanding preventive action and root cause  analysis which explains some of the techniques available for identifying the cause of  non-conformities and preventing them from recurring. The guideline is available from the  BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate. 
If effective corrective or preventive action has not been introduced (e.g. it has been  ineffective at preventing recurrence), a non-conformity may be raised against this clause, in  addition to a non-conformity against the clause that has the recurring issue. 
The BRCGS logo and references to certification status shall be used only in accordance  with the conditions of use detailed in the audit protocol section (Part III, section 6.7) of the  Standard. 
Interpretation Use of the BRCGS logo 
Sites that have gained certification against any of the BRCGS Standards are entitled to  demonstrate their pride in their achievement and use the BRCGS certification logo for  marketing purposes. This means the logo can be used on websites, letter headers, business  cards, etc. 
However, the logo is not a product certification mark, so it (or words stating that the product  was produced in a BRCGS-certificated site) cannot be used on product packaging. The rules  around logo use are highlighted in the protocol of the Standard (Part III, section 6.7) and  further guidance is available in the Brand Guidelines on the BRCGS website. 
Where an auditor finds consumer-facing packaging with any BRCGS logo or wording during  an audit, they will raise a non-conformity.

1.2.2 
	



The chart or associated documentation needs to clearly indicate the responsibilities of each  relevant member of staff with responsibility for the management of food safety, authenticity,  legality or quality. Examples include technical managers, quality assurance staff, section  heads/managers (e.g. those accountable for overseeing production and cleaning activities (i.e.  those responsible for ensuring the correct standards are maintained)), any on-site laboratory  staff and product development teams. 
Responsibilities must be defined for key aspects of the food safety and quality management  system, including, for example, decisions on corrective actions, non-conforming products,  process deviations, finished product release, document control and customer complaints.  It is usual for specific responsibilities to be defined within the job descriptions of key staff  (especially for management and supervisors); however, they may instead be described within  site procedures (e.g. responsibility for decisions on corrective action may be incorporated  into the site’s corrective action procedure). 
It must be clearly documented who is expected to deputise in the absence of a manager.  Deputies would usually be identified on the organisational chart and/or in job descriptions,  but documentation could also be in the form of an additional table. The responsibility  may be assigned to either a more senior or more junior person, as long as the deputy has  the knowledge and ability to adequately cover for the absent manager. Deputies may be  appointed for the whole role or particular responsibilities may be deputised to different  people; as long as this is clearly defined. 
The auditor will be looking for both documented responsibilities and evidence that the  responsible person is able to fulfil the role (clause 7.1.7 requires the company to review the  competencies of staff and ensure that any necessary training, mentoring or experience is  provided). 
The site’s senior management shall ensure that all staff are aware of their responsibilities  and demonstrate that work is carried out in accordance with documented site policies,  procedures, work instructions and existing practices for activities undertaken. All staff shall  have access to relevant documentation. 
Interpretation Staff roles and responsibilities 
The objective of this clause is to ensure that all staff, including temporary staff and  
employment agency staff, are able to work effectively and ensure that food safety,  
authenticity, legality and quality are maintained. 
Consistent application of these systems relies on the correct and established processes  being documented, accessible by relevant staff and used in practice. This will usually be  established by the auditor discussing roles with the employees themselves during the audit.  There is no requirement for a detailed job description; however, staff should be aware of  their particular responsibilities. Where the role or an activity that makes up part of the role  covers a food safety, authenticity, legality or quality issue described within a procedure (e.g. a  CCP or prerequisite programme), the staff must understand what is expected and be able to  access the relevant procedure. 


1.2.3 
	



Staff shall be aware of the need to report any risks or any evidence of unsafe or out-of specification product, equipment, packaging or raw materials, to a designated manager to  enable the resolution of issues requiring immediate action.

Interpretation Reporting product safety risks and non-conforming product 
Where a food safety risk is identified by a staff member, the reporting function and  
subsequent activity should be sufficiently rapid and effective to mitigate any food safety  
risks. 
Identified risks may be associated with, for example, raw materials, work in progress, final  
product, packaging or equipment. Good practice is to encourage staff to report as wide a  
range of situations as possible, including out-of-specification results, damage, errors or when  
the staff member is concerned that something does not look right or as it normally does. 
The transfer of information from staff to senior management regarding unsafe or out-of 
specification situations is an example of a good food safety culture. If staff feel supported  
and empowered to identify and report issues and make positive changes, this will typically  
be reflected in the effectiveness of the site’s product safety management systems.

If the site does not have the appropriate in-house knowledge of food safety, authenticity,  legality or quality, external expertise (e.g. food safety consultants) may be used; however, the  day-to-day management of the food safety systems shall remain the responsibility of the  company.

P
Where external food safety consultants have been used as the main source of technical  
knowledge for a specific activity (e.g. to lead the development of the food safety plan or  
HACCP plan) it is essential that day-to-day responsibilities are under the control of the site  
and that it has personnel in place with working knowledge of the product safety systems,  
who can operate effectively even when the consultant is not available. 
For example, the requirements of clause 1.2.1, regarding deputies and documented  
procedures, apply even where a food safety consultant is used. 
A food safety consultant is seen as a service provider to the site and is therefore subject to  
the requirements of section 3.5.3.

INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE 
2 The food safety plan – HACCP 
Fundamental 
The company shall have a fully implemented and effective food safety plan incorporating the Codex  Alimentarius HACCP principles. 
Interpretation 
The purpose of these requirements is to create a food safety plan to mitigate food safety hazards. The foundation of  this food safety plan is a hazard and risk analysis. In order to be effective this analysis must be systematic, science based, thorough, fully implemented and kept up to date. 
In the food industry, the principles for assessing hazard and risk are commonly referred to as HACCP. However, the  specific terminology used in the Standard, such as prerequisites and critical control points (CCPs), are drawn from  global terminology used to describe expectations. Sites are not required to use the specific terminology used in  the Standard; alternative terminology is acceptable, providing it is evident that all the requirements have been fully  met. For example, legislative requirements in the US (detailed in the Food Safety Modernization Act) use different  terminology but still incorporate all the requirements of the Standard. 
Sites are advised to avoid having multiple plans with different terminology as this is administratively complex  and unnecessary. (It may, of course, be appropriate to have multiple plans where a site produces different types of  products with different product safety hazards, but common terminology should be used throughout.) 
Regardless of the terminology used the food safety plan must incorporate all of the Codex Alimentarius HACCP  principles. The clauses in Issue 9 have been updated to reflect the latest publication of the Codex Alimentarius  HACCP principles, therefore where it is evident that all the requirements in section 2 have been fully met, a site will  not be expected to undertake additional activities to meet the Codex Alimentarius principles. 
The plan must be specific to the products manufactured, processed or packed on site and the production processes  used. 
Codex Alimentarius has published background information and extensive guidance on the HACCP principles which  can be found in the General Principles of Food Hygiene (CXC1-1969) last updated in 2020. It can be downloaded  from the Codex Alimentarius page on the FAO’s website. 
BRCGS offers training on HACCP implementation. Details are available from the BRCGS website. 2.1 The HACCP food safety team (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 1)
Clause 
	Requirements
	2.1.1 
	The HACCP or food safety plan shall be developed and managed by a multi-disciplinary  food safety team that includes those responsible for quality assurance, technical  management, production operations and other relevant functions (e.g. engineering, hygiene). 
The team leader shall have an in-depth knowledge of Codex HACCP principles (or  equivalent) and be able to demonstrate competence, experience and training. Where there is  a legal requirement for specific training, this shall be in place. 
The team members shall have specific knowledge of HACCP and relevant knowledge of  products, processes and associated hazards.

Interpretation The HACCP food safety team (aligned with Codex Alimentarius Step 1) 
For a comprehensive HACCP or food safety plan to be established, maintained and kept up  
to date it needs to be managed by a nominated team with suitable training, relevant skills  
and experience. 
The number of HACCP food safety team members needs to be appropriate to the size and  
structure of the company, as the team will include representatives of each department with  
responsibility for the operation of the Standard (e.g. technical, quality assurance, purchasing,  
engineering, new product development, hygiene/sanitation and senior leadership team).  
There will always be more than one person, since a single person does not constitute a  
‘team’. The team needs knowledge of the types of operations that are carried out at the site  
and the hazards these operations may present to the product. 
It is good practice to document the team members within the study, with a summary of  
their roles, experience and areas of responsibility within the company. Membership of the  
HACCP food safety team needs to be reviewed and, when necessary, updated (e.g. when job  
responsibilities change or personnel leave or join the company). 
The team leader must be able to demonstrate competency and experience in HACCP/food  
I 
safety processes. This can be shown by: 
I
 
t
r
• the quality of the plan 
a
P
• documented evidence of their qualification (e.g. successful completion of an industry 
recognised HACCP training course) 
• demonstrable, extensive experience in implementing or training HACCP. 
The team will need sufficient knowledge of HACCP processes, products manufactured on  
site, production processes and relevant hazards, to facilitate a thorough hazard and risk  
analysis and the creation of an appropriate food safety plan. This may be demonstrated by,  
for example, training records (see clause 7.1.6) that show adequate training (e.g. through an  
industry-recognised training course or good quality internal training) has been given to all  
HACCP food safety team members. Any format or delivery method of training is permitted;  
however, the outcome should be a suitably trained individual capable of executing a HACCP  
or food safety plan as part of their team. 
Where there is a legal requirement for specific training the site is expected to ensure this  
has been completed. 
Where external expertise has been used in developing the HACCP or food safety plan, the  
site must demonstrate ownership of the identified requirements by ensuring that the day 
to-day management of the food safety system remains the responsibility of the site (see  
clause 1.2.4). 
At the audit, the competency and understanding of the HACCP/food safety plan team will  
s 
be assessed, as well as the quality of the resultant HACCP or food safety plan. The site  
e
c
i
should also be able to establish the training and competence of any external consultant in  
d
n
HACCP/food safety principles (see section 3.5.3). 
e
p
Senior management commitment (clauses 1.1.1 to 1.1.14) is required to support the HACCP  
p
A
food safety team. This may be demonstrated by the presence of senior management

Interpretation  
continued 
2.1.2 
	



The existence of a food safety plan does not, in itself, guarantee product safety, and it is vital  that the results of the HACCP or food safety plan are implemented, applied correctly and  integrated into the food safety and quality management system. 
The scope of each HACCP or food safety plan, including the products and processes  covered, shall be defined. 
Interpretation Scope of the HACCP or food safety plan 
The scope of the HACCP or food safety plan must be identified. The scope should describe  all the products and processes to be included within the study. In sites with a small range  of similar products, it may be possible to incorporate all of the products and processes  
into a single HACCP or food safety plan; however, where there is a wide range of different  products or processes with different hazards, it is likely that the site will need to use more  than one plan. 
The format of these plans is not prescribed by the Standard; various formats are acceptable  as long as the scope for each plan is clearly defined and all activities and products are  
covered within the processes. For example, a HACCP or food safety plan may cover each  group of products with similar process characteristics, or the plan may be split into ‘modules’  which cover specific process steps; these modules can then be used in a ‘mix and match’  structure to create a HACCP or food safety plan for any given product. 
2.2 Prerequisite programmes
Clause 
	Requirements
	2.2.1 
	

	The site shall establish and maintain environmental and operational programmes necessary  to create an environment suitable to produce safe and legal food products (prerequisite  programmes). As a guide these may include the following, although this is not an exhaustive  list: 
• cleaning and disinfection (see section 4.11) 
• pest management (see section 4.14) 
• maintenance programmes for equipment and buildings (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) • personal hygiene requirements (see section 7.2) 
• staff training (see section 7.1) 
• supplier approval and purchasing (see section 3.5.1) 
• transportation arrangements (see section 4.16) 
• processes to prevent cross-contamination (see sections 4.9 and 4.10) 
• allergen management (see section 5.3). 
The prerequisite programmes for the particular areas of the site shall take into account the  production risk zoning (see clause 4.3.1). 
The control measures and monitoring procedures for the prerequisite programmes shall  be clearly documented and shall be included within the development and reviews of the  HACCP or food safety plan.

Interpretation Prerequisites 
The prerequisites are the basic environmental and production conditions necessary for the  
manufacture of safe food and the control of generic hazards. Note that the list of examples  
in the Standard is not exhaustive, and others will exist in some sites; for example, utilities,  
air and general aspects of the production environment. Sites must therefore define the full  
range of prerequisites applicable to their site and operations. 
Although the prerequisites are usually covered by day-to-day activities such as good  
manufacturing or hygiene practices, it is vital that they work effectively and to the correct  
standards as: 
• The prerequisite programme needs to provide a solid base on which the rest of the  
HACCP or food safety plan can be developed. 
• The company is relying on the prerequisite activities to mitigate the identified hazards and  
deliver safe product (e.g. if a site identifies cleaning as a prerequisite, then it relies on the  
cleaning activities to adequately remove food residues and dirt that might otherwise result  
in hazards such as allergen cross-contamination or microbiological contamination). 
Therefore there should be a whole work stream behind each identified prerequisite to  
I 
ensure that the relevant activity, procedures and policies are in place, that they are working  
I
 
t
correctly and that they continue to deliver the level of control required. 
r
a
P
Although the prerequisite programme is expected to be effective in achieving the level of  
control required to ensure food safety, it is not a requirement that a documented validation  
of every prerequisite is undertaken, as prerequisite programmes typically cover a wide range  
of general environmental controls, often with results that are not quantifiable. However,  
where a prerequisite programme is used to manage a specific hazard (e.g. cleaning regimes  
used to prevent allergen cross-contamination), there needs to be a documented validation  
that the prerequisite controls the identified hazard (see clause 2.7.4 for further details  
regarding the validation). Some companies prefer to differentiate prerequisites that manage  
specific hazards from other prerequisites by referring to them as operational prerequisites  
(oPRPs). 
Sites that need to meet the requirements of the US Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA)  
should note that they must ensure that preventive controls are subject to validation and  
verification. Some of these controls may cover activities that have traditionally formed part  
of the prerequisite programme. 
The clause contains references to later sections of the Standard which provide detail  
on the requirements for effective management of some specific prerequisites, including  
cleaning (section 4.11), pest management (section 4.14) and training (section 7.1). These are  
not intended to be an exhaustive list of all prerequisites or all the relevant sections of the  
Standard. 
s 
e
The prerequisite programmes are often dependent on the production risk zoning (see clause  
c
i
d
4.3.1); for example, cleaning within a high-risk zone. Therefore it may be necessary to place  
n
e
greater attention on some prerequisites that are particularly important for food safety in  
p
those specific zones. 
p
A
Good practice is to review the prerequisite programmes and their management. The  
frequency of this review should be based on risk, but it could be included, for example, in  
the annual review of the HACCP or food safety plan.

Clause 
	Requirements
	2.3.1 
	A full description for each product or group of products shall be developed, which includes  all relevant information on food safety. As a guide, this may include the following, although  this is not an exhaustive list: 
• composition (e.g. raw materials, ingredients, allergens, recipe) 
• origin of ingredients 
• physical or chemical properties that impact food safety (e.g. pH, aw) 
• treatment and processing (e.g. cooking, cooling) 
• packaging system (e.g. modified atmosphere, vacuum) 
• storage and distribution conditions (e.g. chilled, ambient) 
• maximum safe shelf life under prescribed storage and usage conditions.
	



Interpretation Product description 
A full description of the product is required to ensure that all aspects that could potentially  affect food safety are considered. The Standard gives guidance on the factors that may be  considered: 
• composition (e.g. raw materials or ingredients used, allergens, recipes) 
• origin of the ingredients (e.g. climatic conditions, culture or food safety standards may  make some countries a greater risk than others) 
• physical or chemical properties that impact food safety (e.g. pH, aw) 
• treatment and processing conditions (e.g. cooking, chilling) 
• product packaging system (e.g. modified atmosphere, vacuum packing or canning) 
• storage and distribution conditions (e.g. chilled, frozen or ambient) 
• maximum safe shelf life under prescribed storage and usage conditions. 
Good practice is not to simply describe the product, but to consider the possible  
implications of what will be needed later in the HACCP study. For example, when  
considering the origin of ingredients, rather than just stating the material comes from a  
specific country or region, it may be useful to consider whether the potential climatic  
conditions, culture or food safety standards in the country change the hazards. 
Product groups can be used where the products are similar (e.g. different pack sizes).  
However, where significantly different products (e.g. coated and non-coated meat products)  are manufactured, these are to be treated as separate products or groups.

Up-to-date background information must be taken into account when preparing the HACCP

There are many sources of information, particularly on the internet; for example, Codex  
Alimentarius, European Food Safety Authority, US Food and Drug Administration, or  
the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). Sources of information must be  
referenced in the HACCP or food safety plan and be recoverable or available on request  
(using an internet search engine to find the information during an audit is not acceptable,  
as this implies that the information was not collected and maintained for use during the  
development of the HACCP or food safety plan). A list of legislation and codes of practice  
referenced may be helpful. 
Many membership organisations also provide useful information. Where membership  
information is referenced, this also needs to be available on site (either electronically or as  
hard copy). 
The Standard gives some guidance on the types of information that may be considered in  
developing the HACCP or food safety plan. These include: 
• the latest scientific literature (good practice is to understand the source of the material;  
for example, peer-reviewed science may have greater validity and usefulness) 
• historical and known hazards associated with specific food products (good practice is to

Interpretation Identify the use 
The HACCP food safety team needs to consider and document the intended use of the  products by the customer and the ultimate consumer to ensure all the risks have been  
assessed. For example, the team should consider: 
• the target population (e.g. does this include high-risk groups such as infants, elderly  
people or allergy sufferers?) 
• handling and preparation (e.g. will the product be consumed without further cooking?) • the customer supply chain 
• storage (e.g. frozen, or the requirement for chilled storage after opening the pack). 
Where there is an expected alternative food use for a product, including the potential  
for a customer or consumer to misuse or mistreat the product in a way not intended by  
the manufacturer, this information should be included in the description in the HACCP  assessment so that any implications can be considered as part of the subsequent hazard  analysis. This alternative use may occur in the consumer’s home (e.g. consumption of a  
product that looks ready to eat without completing the correct cooking) or elsewhere in the  supply chain (e.g. an unintended use of a raw material). A number of product recalls have  occurred, for example, with frozen raw vegetables and coated/battered poultry products due  to unintended use of the product. Inclusion of intended and expected alternative uses of a  product can also provide a useful due diligence reference demonstrating to a customer or  regulatory authority the scope of hazards that have been considered.

	A flow diagram shall be prepared to cover each product, product category or process. This  shall set out all aspects of the food process operation within the HACCP or food safety plan  scope, from raw material receipt through to processing, storage and distribution. As a guide,  this should include the following, although this is not an exhaustive list: 
• plan of premises and equipment layout 
• raw materials, including introduction of utilities and other contact materials (e.g. water,  packaging) 
• sequence and interaction of all process steps 
• outsourced processes and subcontracted work 
• potential for process delay 
• rework and recycling 
• low-risk/high-risk/high-care area segregation 
• finished products, intermediate/semi-processed products, by-products and waste.
	



Interpretation Process flow diagram 
I 
The process flow diagram provides the site with an important tool, allowing it to evaluate the  
I
 
t
possible introduction, occurrence or change of hazards at each step of the process. It should  
r
a
therefore be used when identifying hazards (see clause 2.7.1) and conducting hazard analysis  
P
(see clause 2.7.2). 
Therefore, an accurate flow diagram indicating all the process steps, including all inputs and  
outputs, needs to be constructed for each HACCP or food safety plan. This may be achieved  
with a single diagram, or it could be in a modular form with several documents compiled to  
provide the complete information (in this situation it must clearly identify the interaction  
between the process steps). The Standard lists guidance on the points to consider and  
include when developing the flow diagram; for example: 
• a plan of the premises and equipment layout to facilitate consideration of cross 
contamination risks (e.g. allergen control) 
• raw materials – it should be clear where raw materials are stored and the routes they take  
into the production area; this includes the introduction of utilities and other contact  
materials (e.g. water or packaging) 
• sequence and interaction of all process steps (e.g. method of transportation between each  
step) 
• outsourced processes and subcontracted work, including, for example, off-site processing,  
storage, packing or transport 
• potential for process delay (i.e. how products or ingredients will be handled if a delay  
occurs) 
• rework and recycling 
s 
e
• low-risk/high-risk/high-care segregation (i.e. clearly indicating where the different

e
• finished products, intermediate/semi-processed products, by-products and waste (e.g.  
p
where waste products leave the production process, and the storage of intermediates and  
p
A
finished products). 
Clause 3.2.1 of the Standard requires the site to have an effective document control system.  
Signing and dating the approved process flow diagram is one method of demonstrating that  
this is occurring.

Interpretation Verifying the flow diagram 
The flow diagram shall be verified as accurate. A member of the HACCP food safety team  who is based at the site, part of the team, or the whole team must check that the flow  
diagram is accurate by on-site audit. This may be achieved using a physical walk-through of  the process within the production area. A report of the activity and any findings will help to  demonstrate that this has been completed. 
During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will confirm the accuracy of the documented process  flow diagram by following the process in production. 
It is vital that the process flow diagram remains up to date; therefore verification should  occur whenever there is a review of the HACCP or food safety plan (e.g. whenever there  is a change to the plan or operational activity) and at least once per year. For example, the  manufacture of a new product (see clause 5.1.2) should result in a HACCP review to confirm  that any hazards to existing products have been managed appropriately, as well as ensuring  that any hazards affecting the new product are controlled. 
It is important that any daily (e.g. different shifts, including any night or weekend shifts) or  seasonal variations are considered during the verification process (e.g. the production of a  Christmas range that uses ingredients or processes not used during the rest of the year or  significant changes in production volume). 
The site must retain records of the diagrams and verification activities. For example, a  
verification record could include an annotated diagram showing: 
• the date and time of the verification 
• the product(s) being manufactured at the time the activity was observed 
• any amendments or alterations that were noted. 
Alternatively, a separate report could be produced in the format of an internal audit. 
The records should also be signed to confirm who completed the verification.

Interpretation List of potential hazards 
It is expected that the list will include specific hazards. The Standard provides examples of  
those that should be considered, including: 
• specific micro-organisms (e.g. E. coli or Salmonella) 
• specific chemicals (e.g. veterinary residues, pesticides or radiological contaminants) 
• cleaning chemicals 
• machinery lubricants 
• specific foreign bodies (e.g. glass, metal or plastic) 
• specific allergens (e.g. peanuts or egg); i.e. those identified by the company, materials that  
are considered allergens in the country of intended sale and any customer requirements 
• the potential for fraud and/or adulteration 
• malicious tampering with the product or processes. 
It is important that the company considers all relevant potential hazards from all relevant  
sources. These could include raw materials, processes and the factory environment. The  
process flow diagram is a useful tool in considering the potential risks at each stage of  
production. Some sites find it useful to consider each hazard, at each step, in terms of: 
I 
• whether the hazard is likely to be present in, for example, the raw material or the  
I
 
t
processing environment 
r
a
• whether there is the potential to introduce or create a specific hazard at the step in the  
P
process being considered 
• if there is the potential for growth of micro-organisms 
• whether the hazard will survive the processing step; for example, whether a pathogen  
can survive in the product, or whether the contaminant is stable to the process being  
completed (e.g. heat stable). 
There must be a description of each hazard and its sources – one hazard may have several  
potential sources and occur at more than one point in the process. This is important to  
ensure that effective controls for each source of hazard are established in the subsequent  
steps of the process. 
The Standard has referenced food fraud and malicious contamination (food defence) in  
the list of hazards in this clause to draw attention to the need to include these within  
site assessments. However, later sections of the Standard (sections 4.2 and 5.4) provide  
greater detail on the expected activity in these areas. This clause does not require  
those assessments to be repeated or duplicated (as part of the HACCP plan, and then in  
compliance with sections 4.2 and 5.4) – separate assessment processes are acceptable and  
the site can reference the additional assessment within the HACCP plan. However, the  
outputs from those separate assessments must be considered as part of this process, to  
ensure that the correct controls, monitoring, verification, etc. are in place. 
s 
The aim of including radiological hazards within the clause is to consider potential  
e

contamination by radioactive isotopes (a legal requirement in some countries) which

may be present in water or soil (either from a naturally occurring source or resulting from

The HACCP food safety team shall conduct a hazard analysis to identify the significant  hazards (i.e. those hazards that are reasonably likely to occur at an unacceptable level), which  need to be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels. Consideration shall be  given to the following: 
• likely occurrence of hazard 
• severity of the effects on consumer safety 
• vulnerability of those exposed 
• survival and multiplication of micro-organisms of specific concern to the product • presence or production of toxins, chemicals or foreign bodies 
• contamination of raw materials, intermediate/semi-processed product, or finished product. 
Where elimination of the hazard is not practical, justification for acceptable levels of the  hazard in the finished product shall be determined and documented. 
Interpretation Hazard analysis 
Any hazards identified in clause 2.7.1 must be evaluated against the criteria detailed in this  clause to identify those which are significant. For the purposes of the Standard a significant  hazard is a hazard identified by the hazard analysis, which is reasonably likely to occur in the  absence of a control, at an unacceptable level (i.e. a level that would be considered unsafe or  illegal), and therefore control is essential for the production of a safe product. The HACCP  food safety team must therefore take into account: 
• the likely occurrence of the hazard, taking into consideration existing prerequisite  
programmes, the nature of the facility and the equipment used 
• the severity of the effects on consumer safety 
• the vulnerability of those exposed 
• the survival and growth of micro-organisms (i.e. those of concern to the product(s) within  the scope of the HACCP or food safety plan) 
• the presence or production of toxins, chemicals or foreign bodies 
• contamination of raw materials, intermediates, semi-processed product or finished  
product. 
Evidence of the decisions, along with the justification for the decision and the decision making process, must be kept within the HACCP or food safety plan.

There are a range of tools that may assist with the evaluation of hazards (e.g. quadrant  graphs, scoring systems, logic tables or decision trees). The team may choose to use these  tools but should keep a record of any that are deployed. Such tools may also help in  establishing CCPs. 
It is useful to remember that the quality of the output from the assessment depends on  the quality of the data or evidence used. The hazard analysis should, wherever possible, be  based on demonstrable evidence such as documented validation studies, trend analysis  and science-based literature. Where this information is not available at the site, it may be  necessary for the site to obtain it from suppliers or reputable external sources to establish  the likelihood or severity of the specific hazards. 
Where elimination of a hazard is not possible, acceptable levels need to be defined.  Reference should be made to legal requirements or scientific evidence to justify the  acceptable levels (e.g. microbiological standards or presence of mycotoxins). 
The HACCP food safety team shall consider the control measures necessary to prevent or  eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. 
Consideration may be given to using more than one control measure.

Interpretation Control measures 
P
Control measures required to reduce or eliminate the specific hazards (i.e. each hazard  
identified in clause 2.7.1) must be established. Any hazard that cannot be eliminated must  
have control measures designed to reduce it to an acceptable level of presence. This  
acceptable level (e.g. setting a target of <100 cfu/g of Staphylococcus aureus in finished  
product) needs to be justified; in other words the site should understand the potential  
consequences of the hazard and be able to demonstrate that the acceptable level will  
adequately protect the consumer. 
Industry guidelines, codes of practice, legislation etc. can help to establish and justify these  
levels.

Interpretation Validation of prerequisites

the identified hazard. Some companies prefer to differentiate these prerequisites that  manage specific hazards from other prerequisites, by referring to them as operational  prerequisites (oPRPs). 
Examples of prerequisites that require validation include: 
• control of allergen cross-contamination by cleaning the production equipment. Evidence  is required that the cleaning regime can effectively and consistently remove the allergen  (examples of how this might be achieved are given in the guidance to clause 5.3.8). 
• chilled storage conditions for product safety. The defined storage temperature must be  validated by reference to technical literature, confirming the control of growth of relevant  spoilage or food poisoning organisms. The storage facility must be validated as being  capable of consistently delivering the defined temperature. 
Prerequisites used to control specific hazards must also be subject to routine verification  and monitoring, and records should detail the control measures and monitoring procedures  used (see clause 2.12.2 for full details of this requirement). 
2.8 Determine the CCPs (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 7, Principle 2) 
Clause 
	Requirements
	2.8.1 
	For each hazard that requires control, control points shall be reviewed to identify those that  are critical. This requires a logical approach and may be facilitated by use of a decision tree.  CCPs shall be those control points which are required in order to prevent or eliminate a  food safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. If a hazard is identified at a step where  control is necessary for safety but the control does not exist, the product or process shall be  modified at that step, or at an earlier step, to provide a control measure.
	



Interpretation Determine the critical control points – Codex Alimentarius Step 7, Principle 2 
Each control measure must be examined to identify which are critical (i.e. to identify the  points at which control can be applied). This is essential to prevent or eliminate a food  
safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. 
Records must be available showing how this has been conducted and how decisions have  been reached. 
The Standard is not prescriptive on the tools used to facilitate this process; for example,  a two- or four-question decision tree may be useful. The site must, however, be able to  
demonstrate that it has used a logical approach and, therefore, a copy of any decision 
making tools used and the results (e.g. the results of the questions from the decision tree)  must be recorded. 
If a hazard has been identified as critical but there is no control measure at that step or any  other, the product or process should be modified so that a suitable control measure can be  incorporated either at this step or at an earlier point in the process. 
Sites working in accordance with the US Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) are likely to  find that the preventive controls required by that legislation include all of the controls that  would normally be identified as CCPs using a HACCP system. For example, CCPs are known

as process preventive controls (PPCs) in an FSMA-compliant food safety plan. For  certification purposes, it does not matter which terms are referenced as their management  (for certification purposes) would be the same. Other preventive controls are historically  treated as PRPs (prerequisite programmes) in many sites. In some cases, parts of them are  elevated to preventive controls; these include food allergen, sanitation, supply chain, based  on known or reasonably foreseeable risk of a serious adverse health consequence or death  to humans or animals (SAHCODHA) hazard. 
Where the management components of those preventive controls do not contain all the  same elements of the CCPs/PPCs it is expected that the site would combine the most  stringent requirements of FSMA and the Standard together. For example, a sanitation  preventive control does not require validation for allergen cleaning under FSMA but it  is required by the Standard (see clause 2.7.4), therefore the Standard expects additional  compliance with this requirement.

Good practice is often to identify action limits as well as critical limits with the aim of  ensuring the measured parameter remains controlled; i.e. to identify a point at which action  can be taken or a review completed, when the product or process is approaching the critical  limit, but prior to it actually exceeding the critical limit. 
Details on how the critical limits have been determined must be documented; these may  include industry best practice, legislation or validation studies undertaken by the company. 
The HACCP food safety team shall validate each CCP, including critical limits. Documented  evidence shall show that the control measures selected and critical limits identified are  capable of consistently controlling the hazard to the specified acceptable level. 
Interpretation Validation and documentation of critical limits 
Documented evidence must be available showing how the control measures for CCPs and  critical limits have been validated to ensure they control, reduce or eliminate the hazard to  an acceptable level. 
Validation must be specific and demonstrate that if the control measures are followed as  specified and the critical limits are met (at minimum and maximum levels where a range  is indicated), a consistently safe product will be produced. Evidence could come from  
professional bodies, trade associations, historical processing data, scientific and technical  literature or legislation. In addition, scientifically valid experimental or pilot plant trial data  or exercises, such as challenge testing, may be required to confirm the capability of the  
process.

Each CCP needs to be monitored to ensure the established limits are not exceeded. This

A monitoring procedure must be established for each CCP. At a minimum, this should  
include: 
• the CCP to which the procedure relates 
• the staff (or staff role) responsible for monitoring the CCP (clause 1.2.1 requires the staff  
responsible for product safety activities to be documented) 
• training requirements for responsible staff (see clause 7.1.2) 
• the frequency at which the monitoring is completed 
• instructions on how the monitoring is completed 
• the requirements for record-keeping (clause 2.10.2)

	Requirements
	2.11.1 
	The HACCP food safety team shall specify and document the corrective action to be  taken when monitored results indicate a failure to meet a control limit, or when monitored  results indicate a trend towards loss of control. This shall include the action to be taken by  nominated personnel with regard to any products that have been manufactured during the  period when the process was out of control.
	



Interpretation Establish a corrective action plan 
A documented procedure needs to be established, detailing the actions to be taken when  monitoring indicates that limits have been exceeded or when trends suggest they may be  exceeded if no remedial action is taken. 
The site will need to ensure that all CCPs are covered by corrective action plans. This may be  achieved by having a single corrective action document or by individual documents for each  CCP. However, it is important that the identified actions are specific to each CCP and not  simply generic statements. 
The procedure must include: 
• Authorised personnel – identify who can make decisions about product produced where  limits have been exceeded and the corrective actions to be taken. 
• Immediate remedial action to be taken – for example, to bring the process back within  critical limits. 
• Quarantine procedures – instructions on how implicated products (those that have passed  through the process and may therefore have exceeded the limits) are identified, handled,  isolated and/or stored until their safety status is established (e.g. products that have been  
metal-detected since the last satisfactory metal detector check). The handling and storage  procedure must ensure that implicated product cannot enter production or be distributed  to customers unless it has been confirmed as safe and released by the authorised staff. 
• Disposal procedures for unsafe products. 
• Additional actions that may be required (e.g. alternative processing, increased monitoring,  etc.). 
Good practice is to use root cause analysis, where possible, to identify and correct the  
fundamental cause of the out-of-specification result. 
All actions should be recorded. 
When investigation shows that the implicated product is safe and can be released to  
customers it may be necessary to review the critical limit, as the ‘safe’ product implies that  the critical limit has not been set at the correct value. 
2.12 Validate the HACCP plan and establish verification procedures (equivalent to  Codex Alimentarius Step 11, Principle 6) 
Interpretation 
Validation is defined as obtaining evidence through the provision of objective evidence that a control or measure,  if properly implemented, is capable of delivering the specified outcome. In other words, it is objectively confirming  that the plan will perform, effectively, as intended.

Similarly, verification is the application of methods, procedures, tests and other evaluations, in addition to  monitoring, to determine whether a control or measure is or has been operating as intended. In other words,  verification seeks to answer the question, ‘Has it been operating effectively, as intended?’ Codex Alimentarius has  published guidelines for the validation of food safety control measures (CXG 69-2008) which can be downloaded  from the Codex Alimentarius guidelines page of the FAO’s website. 
Clause

	2.12.1 
	HACCP or food safety plans shall be validated prior to any changes which may affect  product safety, to ensure that the plan will effectively control the identified hazards before  implementation.

Interpretation Validation of the HACCP or food safety plan 
It is important that the site validates the food safety plan to confirm it will perform,  
effectively, as intended, and therefore prevent food safety hazards from occurring. In other  
words, the site should assess whether what it intends to put in place will actually work in  
practice. 
I 
I
Obviously, to be effective this validation needs to be completed before the plan is  
 
t
r
implemented and before any changes are made (e.g. in production) that could affect food  
a
P
safety. 
In some countries (e.g. the US), there is an additional legal requirement for a revalidation  
after implementation, which must occur within a specified timescale, such as 90 days. This  
is good practice as it allows sites to consider the effects of upscaling (i.e. moving from trial  
systems to full production) or any other changes that may have occurred during the first few  
weeks of production, and therefore ensure that the plan still accurately reflects the actual  
production. Sites operating in countries where this is not a legal requirement may also find  
this a useful good-practice addition to their ways of working. 
There are a number of aspects of the plan that should be validated, including: 
• production process flow 
• identification of the correct hazards at the correct steps of the process 
• identification of the correct CCPs 
• the establishment of monitoring and verification activities, including what to monitor and  
how frequently 
• critical limits and the corrective actions associated with each CCP. 
Validation in this context could include a range of activities, depending on the relevant  
hazards, such as: 
• review of literature

• mathematical modelling

Results of verification shall be recorded and communicated to the HACCP food safety team.
	



Interpretation Establish verification procedures 
The HACCP or food safety plan, including controls managed by prerequisites, must be  verified to ensure that it remains effective. 
Verification requires objective evidence that the specified requirements are being met.  This may include verification that monitoring has been completed correctly, that results  are understood and that appropriate corrective actions have been completed. Examples of  activity that can be included in verification studies are: 
• internal audits (e.g. to ensure the correct procedures and work instructions are in use and  that monitoring frequencies are correct) 
• review and trending of records (e.g. CCP monitoring records) 
• review of complaints by enforcement authorities or customers 
• review of incidents (e.g. product withdrawal or recall). 
The results of this verification must be documented and communicated to the HACCP or  food safety team as part of the review process. 
Verification should be completed to a planned schedule. 


2.12.3 
	

	



The HACCP food safety team shall review the HACCP or food safety plan and prerequisite  programmes at least annually and prior to any changes which may affect food safety. As a  guide, these may include the following, although this is not an exhaustive list: 
• change in raw materials or supplier of raw materials 
• change in ingredients/recipe 
• change in processing conditions, cleaning and disinfection procedures, process flow or  equipment 
• change in packaging, storage or distribution conditions 
• change in consumer use 
• emergence of a new risk (e.g. known adulteration of an ingredient or other relevant,  published information, such as the recall of a similar product) 
• review following a significant product safety incident (e.g. a product recall) • new developments in scientific information associated with ingredients, process,  packaging or product. 
Appropriate changes resulting from the review shall be incorporated into the HACCP or  food safety plan and/or prerequisite programmes. Changes shall be fully documented, and  the validation shall be recorded. 
Where appropriate, the changes shall also be reflected in the company’s product safety  policy and food safety objectives.

Interpretation Review of the HACCP plan 
The HACCP or food safety plan and associated prerequisite programmes must be reviewed  
regularly, at a minimum of once a year, even if there have been no changes to the product  
range or processing methods. Some or all of the plan should be reviewed whenever there is  
a significant change. 
Changes that may affect product safety, such as those listed in this clause, need to be  
evaluated in the context of the plan before they are introduced, and the plan amended as  
necessary. 
A procedure could be documented that lists the activities or changes which trigger a  
HACCP review, but this would have to be backed up by documented evidence that the  
review has actually been carried out (e.g. by documenting minutes of the meeting or an  
agreed action plan). 
In the case of published incidents (e.g. recalls or media stories), it is good practice to  
consider whether the product involved is similar to those produced at the site, and therefore  
whether a similar problem could occur with the site’s products. Where a genuine risk is  
identified, the site should complete a review of the existing HACCP controls to establish  
I 
whether they remain sufficient or whether amendments are required. However, it is not a

3 Food safety and quality management system 
3.1 Food safety and quality manual 
The company’s processes and procedures to meet the requirements of this Standard shall be documented to  allow effective, consistent application, facilitate training, and support due diligence in the production of a safe  product. 
Interpretation 
A well-documented, systematic management system forms the basis for the product and process controls necessary  to produce safe products, meet the requirements of the Standard, meet customer specifications and enable staff to  be trained and informed. 
In many instances, the Standard specifically states that requirements shall be satisfied by documented procedures;  in others, this is implied as the company needs to ensure consistent application throughout the site and show that  systems are in place to demonstrate food safety to external stakeholders (including regulatory authorities, customers  and the BRCGS auditor). The Standard therefore requires policies, procedures, records, risk assessments, etc., to be  documented in sufficient detail to achieve these aims. 
The Standard does not prescribe a review frequency for the food safety and quality manual, or the documents within  it; however, good practice is to update the manual, or relevant parts of it, whenever there is a change to processes or  procedures. 
Clause 
	Requirements
	3.1.1 
	The site’s procedures, working methods and practices shall be collated in the form of a  printed or electronic quality manual.
	



Interpretation The food safety and quality manual 
Policies, procedures and work instructions must be in place, easily retrievable and available  where needed, and must cover the requirements of the Standard. These documents must be  collated into one or more quality manuals which form the reference point for all documents  included in the food safety and quality system. 
These documents may exist on paper (i.e. as hard copy) or may be controlled on an  
electronic system. In either case, they should be easy to follow and kept up to date. 
In a small, simple operation, the manual may contain the majority of the procedures  
controlling the processes. In a complex operation it may contain the headline policies and  indicate where more detailed operating instructions can be found. 
The manual should include an overview of how the company’s policies and procedures are  organised. This organisation should be understood by those using the documents and easily  demonstrated. Where the site is part of a company governed by a head office, the interaction  between the site’s documented system and that of the other sites and the head office  
should be clear. All policies and procedures necessary for the operation of the site being  assessed must be available at that site. 
There is no requirement for sites to have a quality manual that is numbered in accordance  with the Standard’s numbering system.

Interpretation Availability of the manual to staff 
The objective of this requirement is to ensure that key staff have access to up-to-date  
policies and procedures at all times and in the most appropriate format. For example, the  
incident management procedure should be available to the relevant team members via  
internet link, hard copy or other off-site format. 
Staff needing such documents as part of their role within the company must always  
have access to them. During the audit the procedures documented in the manual will  
be evaluated against the actual practices on the site, with the expectation that they are  
followed correctly. 


3.1.3 
	

	



All procedures and work instructions shall be clearly legible, unambiguous, in appropriate  languages and sufficiently detailed to enable their correct application by appropriate staff.  This should include the use of photographs, diagrams or other pictorial instructions where

I
language). 
 
t
r
a
P
Interpretation Clear procedures and work instructions for staff 
Procedures and work instructions must be documented in a clear and unambiguous format. 
Anyone using an authorised document must be able to understand its relevance, what it is  
for and how to use it. Evidence is required to demonstrate that staff clearly understand the  
procedures as this will be challenged by the auditor. 
Consideration may be given to providing procedures in appropriate languages, either written  
or oral, to ensure staff understand the documents and their role. Where translations are  
used, a record should be kept of who translated the information into which language(s). Both  
the translator and the recipient staff should sign the training record to indicate that the  
translated version has been understood. 
Documentation should include the use of photographs, diagrams or other pictorial  
instructions where written communication alone is not sufficient. For example, diagrams  
added to cleaning instructions can show clearly which pieces of equipment to remove or  
focus on. Signs and pictures can be particularly useful for communicating personal hygiene  
and protective clothing requirements.

They may be available on paper  (i.e. as hard copy) or in electronic format.

FOOD SAFETY 
ISSUE 9 
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE 
Key documents found to be in use during the audit that have not been properly authorised or are not the correct  version may lead to a non-conformity. 
Clause 
	Requirements
	3.2.1 
	The company shall have a procedure to manage documents which form part of the food  safety and quality system. This shall include: 
• a list of all controlled documents indicating the latest version number • the method for the identification and authorisation of controlled documents • a record of the reason for any changes or amendments to documents 
• the system for the replacement of existing documents when these are updated. Where documents are stored in electronic form these shall also be: 
• stored securely (e.g. with authorised access, control of amendments, or password protection) • backed up to prevent loss.
	



Interpretation Documented management system 
The control of all documents within the food safety and quality system (for both external  and internal use) is important for several reasons, including: 
• the documents are kept up to date 
• staff are working with the correct version 
• the potential for mistakes caused by multiple versions of a document is minimised. 
Therefore all documents in use need to be properly authorised and must be the correct  version. 
The Standard requires the site to have a documented procedure that describes the method by  which documents are controlled and managed. This procedure needs to include instructions  on how the following features of the document management system are controlled: 
• responsibilities for the management of the system 
• list of all controlled documents, indicating the current version number and the allocation  of controlled copies of the document (see below) 
• identification of controlled documents (e.g. document ID, issue date, version number) 
• records of the reason for any change(s) (see below) 
• method of rescinding and replacing documents. 
In order to demonstrate the control of document issue, it is necessary to maintain a  
register of all controlled documents, their allocation and issue status. Where the controlled  documents are all contained on an electronic system, it is usual for printed versions to be  marked as uncontrolled. Each copy must be authorised (e.g. with a signature or stamp) to  show it is for use, and each must be given a version number so that out-of-date documents  can be identified and removed. This must be evidenced by the fact that all documents in use  are the most up-to-date versions. 
Where documents are maintained electronically, the site is required to ensure that they are  stored securely and cannot be amended by unauthorised persons; for example, by using  individual passwords or security swipe cards. This includes backing them up appropriately to  ensure no data is lost. The auditor will ask to see evidence (e.g. a procedure) that the site has  an effective backup process, rather than auditing that the backup contains all the relevant  files.

Interpretation  continued 
The methodology or type of electronic storage is not specified. The site may choose to use  an internal server to store data; or it may use cloud services, which are generally considered  to be secure and backed up, providing there is control of authorised/authenticated users. 
When a document is changed, a record needs to be made of the change and the reason for  it. This can be achieved by keeping a copy of the previous version with the reason for the  change written on it, or by keeping a history of amendments. Consideration should also be  given to the most effective method of communicating the changes to staff; for example, by  highlighting the change within the new document or training relevant staff. 
Further guidance How to put a document control procedure in place 
Firstly, ensure there is a single, clear, documented system that operates across all documents  within the food safety and quality management system and that it includes the minimum  
requirements highlighted in the Standard: 
• identification of the individual(s) responsible for management of the system (i.e. who is  
authorised to issue or amend documents). This might be someone with the authority to  
instigate and maintain the system 
• the list of all controlled documents 
I 
I
 
• methods of identification of controlled documents 
t
r
a
• records regarding the reasons for any changes 
P
• the method of collecting and replacing documents. 
List of documents 
Your site needs a list of all the documents within the food safety and quality system.  
Typically this will include: 
• the document identification or number. The Standard does not set out how you should  
identify your documents, but an example format would be using sequentially numbered  
documents or an initial letter (often representing a department or activity) followed by a  
number (e.g. P0123); Figure 6 shows an example 
• the document title. Use a concise title that clearly explains the purpose or content of the  
document (e.g. ‘metal detector check procedure’) 
• the current issue or version number. Each time the document is updated, amended or  
replaced, a new version number should be used 
• the issue date. Include the date when the current version of the document first came into  
force 
• withdrawal date (if applicable) 
• review date (if applicable). Documents may require periodic review to ensure the  
information remains applicable and up to date 
• the allocation of controlled copies (i.e. who has a copy of the document).

Identification and authorisation of your documents 
The simplest way to identify your document is to include a footer on each page that  contains the relevant information, as shown in Figure 7. This may include the: 
• document reference 
• issue or version number 
• title of the document 
• date of issue 
• page number and total number of pages. 
REFERENCE: P101 TITLE: METAL DETECTOR CHECK PROCEDURE Version Number: 2 Page: 1 of 5 Issue Date: 1st January 2020 
G001 Acceptance of Raw Materials Version 1 Page 3 of 4 Issued: 1/1/20 Figure 7 Typical formats for footers 
You will need to include a method of authorisation too (e.g. a signature or a stamp that  identifies genuine copies of the document). Where these are held electronically, it may be  more convenient to label printed copies as uncontrolled copies. 
Making changes to your documents 
When a document is changed, you will need to make a note of the change and the reason for  it. You can do this by: 
• keeping a copy of the previous version with the reason for the change written on it, or • keeping a ‘history of amendments’ log within each document; Figure 8 shows an example.

3.3 Record completion and maintenance 
The site shall maintain genuine records to demonstrate the effective control of product safety, legality and  quality. 
Interpretation 
Records are documented information that provide permanent evidence about past events – particularly events  concerning product safety, quality and legality. Records must therefore be maintained in an appropriate way to  ensure they demonstrate control of systems and operations. 
Where records are kept electronically, it is good practice to ensure that the IT management system facilitates good  quality, secure, accurate record-keeping. For example, it should: 
• include suitable systems for storing and backup of data (it may be useful to check the effectiveness of the system  
s 
to restore data, e.g. as part of the incident management procedures detailed in section 3.11)

• stored securely (e.g. with authorised access, control of amendments, or password  protection) 
• suitably backed up to prevent loss.
	



Interpretation Record completion 
Records must be legible and genuine; for example, they must be completed at the time of  the checks (i.e. not before or after the event) and in an appropriate manner (e.g. using a pen,  as pencil could be altered after the event). Records should be appropriately authorised; this  may include the initials or signature of the operator or supervisor verifying the records. 
Any alterations to records need to be justified and authorised. A suitable procedure must be  in place to manage any mistakes that are made (e.g. neatly crossing through the ‘inaccurate’  information, noting the reason for the error and giving the initials of the person making  the change). Note that the use of correction fluid is not acceptable as this makes the initial  information illegible. 
Records must be retrievable when required (e.g. during an audit or the investigation of a  customer complaint), and must therefore be maintained and stored to allow this (e.g. by  being appropriately filed by date or reference number and in such a way that they are still  legible within the specified storage timeframe). They must be created in such a manner that  they accurately transmit the intended information (e.g. they can be read by others and are  traceable to the creator of the record via initials or signature). 
Where records are stored electronically, this storage must be secure. The site should  
ensure that passwords or other mechanisms required to access records are known only by  the people who need to use them. When using electronic systems, it may also be useful to  assign different access levels; for example, for staff who can view records, and for those who  can also add or amend existing data. 
Electronic documents must be suitably backed up to prevent loss. Consideration should be  given to testing electronic retrieval systems, and records of these tests should be retained. 


3.3.2 
	



Records shall be retained for a defined period with consideration given to:

This shall take into account, where it is specified on the label, the possibility that shelf life  may be extended by the consumer (e.g. by freezing). 
At a minimum, records shall be retained for the shelf life of the product plus 12 months.

Interpretation Record storage 
The retention time for records must be established by the company, and procedures put in  
place for appropriate handling, so that records are retained in good condition for this period  
and are retrievable. Consideration should be given to the potential for degradation during  
storage (e.g. due to fading ink, degradation of thermal paper or breakdown of electronic  
media). 
Records that may be called upon to demonstrate the safety, authenticity or legality of  
the product must be kept for an appropriate period. Examples of appropriate periods for  
products or ingredients are as follows: 
• Final products A period not less than the indicated shelf life plus 1 year. 
• Ingredients (i.e. where the site sells an ingredient that will be used in the manufacture of a  
final product) The shelf life of the final product plus 1 year. Where the final-product shelf  
life is not reasonably known, records should be kept for 3 years or a period agreed with  
customers. 
• Products of an undefined shelf life (e.g. some wines and alcoholic drinks) The company  
should define a reasonable record retention period based on experience of customer  
usage, time for complaints and any legal precedents. It would be usual for records to be  
I 
I
 
kept for at least 3 years in these situations. 
t
r
a
Additional retention time may be required by legislation, by customers or because of  
P
the nature of the product (e.g. extension beyond the normal shelf life by the inclusion of  
customer freezing instructions on the product packaging must be observed). 
As records may be called upon by a customer as part of a legal defence, consideration  
should be given to the length of time that may pass from production of a product to  
notification of impending legal action in the country of sale. 
Some regions have specific legal requirements. FSMA legislation, for example, requires a  
storage period of a minimum of 2 years for all documents and records relating to the food  
safety plan, and records must be retrievable within 24 hours, even when stored off site. 
3.4 Internal audits 
Fundamental 
The company shall be able to demonstrate that it verifies the effective application of the food safety  plan, and the implementation of the requirements of the Global Standard Food Safety and the site’s  food safety and quality management system. 
Interpretation 
s 
e
An internal audit is any audit completed by or on behalf of the company rather than by a second or third party. In  
c
i
d
second-party audits, the company carrying out the audit may have a commercial interest (e.g. a customer audit), while  n
a third-party audit is generally conducted by an independent organisation (e.g. a certification body). 
e
p
p
A
Internal audits are one of the most powerful self-assessment tools that a site has available; they are a key factor  in ensuring continued compliance with the requirements of the Standard, and the operation of its food safety and  quality management systems. They must therefore be regarded by the management of the company as critical to its  operation, and this section of the Standard is listed as fundamental to food safety and compliance with the Standard.
brcgs.com 69 
FOOD SAFETY 
ISSUE 9 
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE 
The internal audit programme can be used to: 
• confirm that the product safety and quality management systems are correct and effective • verify that product safety, authenticity, legality and quality activities and processes are being completed correctly  (i.e. the actual work completed) 
• monitor and confirm that products are manufactured correctly 
• provide early identification of potential risks or potential non-conformities (sometimes referred to as near-misses),  allowing timely correction such that they do not become actual non-conformities 
• identify areas for improvement 
• undertake verification of systems (a crucial step within the control of the HACCP or food safety plan; e.g. see  clause 2.12.2). 
The site’s attitude towards its internal audit programme is also likely to indicate its food safety and quality culture.  For example, a site with a poor food safety culture may be tempted to: 
• reduce the number of internal audits and inspections to the minimum, rather than the level indicated by thorough  risk assessment 
• under-report non-conformity and near-misses (i.e. find less than exist in reality) 
• not follow up on non-conformities (e.g. corrective, preventive actions and root cause analysis). 
The scope of the internal audit programme must cover all areas of the food safety and quality management system,  including all the requirements of the Standard, implementation of the HACCP or food safety plan, prerequisite  programmes and procedures, food defence and prevention of food fraud. It must also cover both the systems in  place and the work practices. 
It is not a requirement of the Standard that all of the internal audits in the programme are completed prior to the  site’s BRCGS audit. However, the Standard does require the site to have a planned schedule, with audit dates spread  throughout the year, and for the site to complete the individual audits according to this schedule (see details below).  For sites that are already certificated the auditor may review the internal audits from the previous year, if the BRCGS  audit occurs early in the year, and little of the current year’s schedule has been completed. 
The Standard is not prescriptive on the type of auditing techniques used during internal audits, and the site may  therefore choose the most applicable techniques for the activity being audited. For example, there are some areas  that may be auditable remotely, while others are likely to require physical, on-site auditing techniques. Whichever  techniques the site uses, it is still expected to have an effective audit programme. That means being able to  demonstrate that the systems associated with the food safety plan, the Standard and the food safety and quality  management system are operating effectively and as intended.

Interpretation Internal audit programme 
a
P
The scope of internal audits needs to be established and must ensure that all aspects  
of the food safety and quality management systems (including the HACCP programme,  
prerequisite programmes, policies, documentation, hygiene and production), the product  
safety and quality culture plan, and systems associated with authenticity, product legality  
and quality management are audited at least annually. 
All the internal audits should not be conducted on a single day; nor should every internal  
audit attempt to cover all aspects of the food safety and quality management system or  
the Standard. A once-a-year check against all the requirements of the Standard may be of  
value as a gap analysis when preparing for an audit or confirming the contents of the food  
safety and quality management systems, but is insufficient to cover the full requirements  
of an internal audit programme as it will not provide the depth of assessment or level of  
confidence required. 
Development of the internal audit schedule should begin with a risk assessment. The aim of  
this is to identify: 
• all the areas or activities that need to be audited 
• the frequency with which each part of the product safety and quality management system

• the most relevant dates for each internal audit; for example, if activities or processes are  seasonal (see below) or if specific activities need to be completed more than once a year.  Sites may also find it useful to consider completing internal audits during different shifts,  including, for example, nights or weekends. 
The majority of sites are likely to benefit from a programme of audit dates spread diversely  throughout the year, as this maximises the opportunity to identify any non-conforming  processes in a timely manner, allowing correction and minimising the potential for standards  to fall between audits. The Standard promotes this concept by requiring a minimum of  four audit dates spread throughout the year. However, it does not require all audits to be  completed quarterly, as there may be genuine situations where risk assessment shows an  alternative frequency. Seasonality is an example; if a site is open only for part of the year,  then there is little value in completing internal audits while the site is shut. For seasonal  production, the site is not expected to complete a series of internal audits when the site is  not operating; however, there must be a system for the management of start-up processes,  and internal audits are therefore expected to start before the season commences to ensure  the site is ready to start production. For example, the HACCP programme should be audited  to ensure that it is up to date and appropriate for the forthcoming production; that hygiene  and fabrication are correct; and that staff are appropriately trained. The remaining areas of  the internal audit programme should be covered throughout the season. Further information  is available in the BRCGS Fresh Produce Guideline available from BRCGS Participate or the  BRCGS Store. 
Even where a site is open throughout the year, seasonality can affect the internal audit  dates; for example, if certain activities, such as the harvest of grapes or bottling of wine, are  only completed at certain times, or if there are seasonal changes in production volumes  which apply a greater burden on the product safety systems at certain times of year. Where  a site is part of a multi-site company, and the company conducts annual corporate food  safety audits, it is acceptable for this annual audit to be incorporated into the internal audit  schedule. However, additional internal audits that look at specific parts of the food safety  and quality system, and compliance with the Standard, should be scheduled throughout the  rest of the year. 
The most common way of completing an internal audit is by taking documented procedures  and work instructions and comparing them with the actual working practices and records.  Note that a tick-box exercise is not sufficient, as it does not provide the rigour or depth that  an effective internal audit programme requires. 
The use of an external consultant (e.g. by small sites) is acceptable, providing the internal  audit programme is scheduled throughout the year and not in a single block of activity.  See clause 1.2.4 and section 3.5.3 for details relating to the requirements for product safety  consultants. 
BRCGS has produced a guideline to internal auditing which is available on  BRCGS Participate or from the BRCGS Store. 
Internal audits shall be carried out by appropriately trained, competent auditors. Auditors  shall be independent (i.e. not audit their own work).

Interpretation Auditor training and independence 
Good auditing is a thorough, evidence-based assessment of an activity or system, completed  
by an independent auditor. It should ultimately contribute towards the site’s continuous  
improvement. 
Auditing is therefore an acquired skill and auditors need to be trained and competent to  
ensure they are carrying out this function effectively. Training should include: 
• auditing skills, such as how to complete an effective audit 
• relevant technical knowledge of the activity to be audited, such as HACCP or appropriate  
product technical knowledge. This may be by work experience in the sector or specific  
training 
• soft skills associated with auditing. 
Internal auditors must be able to show via training records (clause 7.1.6) that they have  
received formal training on internal auditing, via either attendance at an external course or  
training within the company. 
Training should also cover the planning and scheduling of the internal audits, preparing  
audit reports in the company’s agreed format, the correct use of audit techniques (e.g.  
I 
I
 
documentation and process auditing, audit trails and discussions with colleagues) and  
t
r
follow-up of audit findings (see clause 3.4.3). 
a
P
Training must be of sufficient duration and depth to ensure that auditors can complete  
robust, consistent audits. 
External auditors may be used where internal resources are insufficient, providing the  
requirements of clause 3.4.1 can be met (for scheduling audits throughout the year). The site  
should refer to clause 1.2.4 and section 3.5.3 for the requirements for the management of  
food safety consultants. 
Internal auditors must be independent of the process being audited. This is to ensure that  
there is no conflict of interest (i.e. that the audit is rigorous and thorough) and that any work  
needed to make corrections or improvements can be identified by an auditor who is not  
biased or influenced by working in the area. Internal auditors may not audit their own work  
or any programmes for which they are immediately responsible. It is not acceptable, for  
example, for workers on one shift to audit the work of another shift completing the same  
work, as they are not independent of the operation. 
During the BRCGS audit, the auditor may discuss the process with internal auditors to  
establish their level of competence. 
Sites may find it useful to calibrate their internal auditor team (e.g. at the beginning of the  
year, before a new schedule of internal audits begins) to ensure that there is a consistent  
approach across the company.

	The internal audit programme shall be fully implemented. Internal audit reports shall  identify conformity as well as non-conformity and include objective evidence of the  findings. 
The results shall be reported to the personnel responsible for the activity audited. 
Corrective and preventive actions, and timescales for their implementation, shall be agreed  and their completion verified. All non-conformities shall be handled as detailed in section  3.7. A summary of the results shall be reviewed in the management review meetings (see  clause 1.1.4).
	



Interpretation Internal audit records and corrective actions 
The management review processes (see clause 1.1.4) must ensure that the internal audit  programme operates effectively and that necessary corrective or preventive actions are  appropriately completed. As a result, the internal audit process will often contain a number  of steps. For example: 
• internal audit completed 
• corrective actions agreed 
• corrective actions completed and signed off 
• completion verified 
• root cause analysis used to identify any necessary preventive actions 
• preventive actions completed and reviewed 
• overall management review completed. 
Each internal audit must examine the process or activity in detail and will usually include a  number of activities such as: 
• observing how activities are completed 
• asking relevant staff how an activity is completed or why it is completed in a specific way • reviewing procedures and records to confirm whether the activity has been completed and  recorded correctly. 
In addition to the actual internal audit, it is important that appropriate reports are  
completed, clearly indicating what was audited, the actions that are agreed and the review of  these actions. 
Reports must show evidence of conformity as well as non-conformity, with objective  
supporting evidence (e.g. what documents or actions were observed). Some sites have also  found it useful to include recommendations for improvement, where the audit can highlight  any that are noted during the audit. 
Tick lists showing that items have been assessed will not normally be accepted as the  only form of evidence; information showing how the audited items have fulfilled the  
requirements, or how they are non-compliant, is required. This is important, as recording  conformity is documenting evidence that due diligence is taking place; in other words,  that required procedures are taking place, and have been observed by auditors who are  independent of the process. This may subsequently be useful, for example, in the event of  an incident, or for answering questions from regulatory authorities or customers.

Interpretation  continued 
Notes, references or copies of the documents and records should be kept as evidence of  aspects that have been examined, to allow an independent reviewer to reach the same  conclusion as the internal auditor. For example, the dates and titles of records that were  inspected should be noted in sufficient detail to allow them to be traced; if any records are  non-compliant, precise details of the non-compliance should be given. The listing of records  reviewed also ensures that a wide range of records are considered (e.g. training records of  a variety of staff rather than repeated audits of the same records). Records will also confirm  whether anything has changed since the last audit. 
The Standard is not prescriptive regarding the format of the internal audit reports; for  example, they may be hand-written, stand-alone electronic documents or uploaded into a  company database. Good practice is to retain any auditor notes that are completed during  the audit, as well as the final report. Figure 9 shows a typical example of a completed audit  report. 
The results of audits need to be communicated to the relevant staff; i.e. those who are  responsible for the area or activity, and corrective actions, root cause and preventive  actions and timescales for their completion agreed. This may be achieved via operational  or review meetings, or via an update at the end of the audit combined with documentation  I 
such as a memo or a copy of the audit report. Responsibility for corrective actions must be  
I

documented – for example, by being recorded on the audit record sheet. Full details for  a
P
handling non-conformities, including corrective and preventive actions, are provided in  section 3.7. 
Note that finding a non-conformity during an internal audit should not necessarily be  viewed as a negative, since it allows the site to implement action before the non-conformity  becomes a more serious problem. 
Where non-conformities have been identified, effective completion of corrective and  preventive action must be verified. Good practice is to ensure that a nominated member  of staff with the appropriate authority checks that the action has been taken within the  agreed timescale, and that this has rectified the problem sufficiently to prevent recurrence.  The nominated staff member should not be the person responsible for completion of the  actions; ideally this should be the original auditor. 
Good practice is to complete a review of the internal audit programme; for example, looking  at the outputs and trends, and any insight these provide. A summary of the programme and  results will also be required for the management review meeting (see clause 1.1.4). 
A non-conformity will be raised against clause 3.4.3 if there is a non-conformity in the  operation of the internal audit programme itself. Examples include if the audit schedule is  not properly implemented or if corrective and preventive actions are not completed within  the agreed timescales.

Interpretation Documented inspections 
I 
I
 
t
In addition to the internal audit programme the Standard requires a programme of  
r
a
documented inspections to ensure that the factory environment and processing equipment  
P
are maintained in a suitable condition. These inspections are different from the internal  
audit programme specified in clauses 3.4.1 to 3.4.3, which examines practices against  
documented procedures. Audits are an in-depth challenge to the systems and procedures  
that a site has put in place to manage hazards, to confirm that the site is effectively  
mitigating identified risks. A documented inspection, however, is a simpler approach to  
assessing the conditions present, so an entirely separate inspection plan should be in place. 
These hygiene- and fabrication-based inspections assess standards of cleaning, equipment,  
building fabrication and personal hygiene to ensure that high standards are maintained and  
that a safe, hygienic production environment is in place. For example, inspections should  
include: 
• appropriateness, status, state of repair and cleaning of doors, walls, floors and other  
fabrication and facilities (e.g. those detailed in section 4.4) 
• hygiene inspection to confirm equipment and facilities have been suitably cleaned 
• equipment inspection to identify and control potential foreign bodies (e.g. from worn or  
damaged equipment) before they have the opportunity to contaminate a product. 
The frequency of the inspections should be based on risk. For open product areas,  
inspections need to be at least monthly, whereas inspections in high-care and high-risk areas  
are likely to be more frequent (e.g. daily or weekly); seasonal products or activities should be  
s 
included where appropriate. Line start-up checks, which may occur daily or at shift changes  
e
c
i
in many operations, can form part of this inspection programme. 
d
n
e
It is also good practice to complete inspections after any activities that potentially change  
p
the risk to products; for example, after maintenance. 
p
A
A review of the inspection programme should be completed prior to any changes which may  
affect food safety; for example:

• introducing new equipment or facilities 
• changes to products 
• changes to processing conditions or process flow 
• following a non-conformity in an audit (e.g. internal, BRCGS, customer, or regulatory audit)  or an independent inspection (e.g. following recommendations for improvement from the  pest control in-depth survey). 
The individuals responsible for completing these inspections should be suitably trained  for the systems they are checking. However, staff completing hygiene and fabrication  inspections do not need the same level of training as internal auditors. 
The absolute requirements for independence identified in clause 3.4.2 do not always apply  to these inspections; for example, it would be acceptable for line start-up checks to be  carried out by line supervisors or managers. External agencies may be used to carry out  inspections. 
It is important that issues identified at the inspections are corrected as soon as possible so  that product risk is minimised. The records of inspections and corrective actions must be  retained. 
Inspection records can provide useful information to identify trends and drive  improvements (e.g. through the use of scored inspection results). To facilitate this, and to  promote discussions about improvements to hygiene and fabrication, a summary of the  results will be discussed at the management review meetings (see clause 1.1.4). 
3.5 Supplier and raw material approval and performance monitoring 3.5.1 Management of suppliers of raw materials and packaging 
Fundamental 
The company shall have an effective supplier approval and monitoring system to ensure that any  potential risks from raw materials (including primary packaging) to the safety, authenticity, legality  and quality of the final product are understood and managed. 
Interpretation 
All materials brought onto the site to become part of the final product must be sourced through approved suppliers  and monitored. This approval process and programme for monitoring raw materials will consider the potential risk  the material represents (in terms of safety, authenticity, legality and quality). 
Primary packaging materials are also included in this requirement. Packaging is vital to product integrity in the  packing environment, and during storage and distribution within the supply chain. Primary packaging is defined in the  Standard as: 
‘The packaging that constitutes the unit of sale to the consumer or customer (e.g. bottle, closure, label and tamper evident seal of a retail pack or a raw material bulk container).’ (A full explanation is available in the glossary.) 
The supplier approval system must consist of an initial approval process and an ongoing monitoring process. 
The risk assessment process should help to focus increased attention on the raw materials or suppliers that present  a greater risk.
