Part I
Introduction
Welcome to the interpretation guideline for the ninth issue of the Global Standard Food Safety (hereafter referred 
to as the Standard). The interpretation guideline is designed to accompany Issue 9 of the Standard and should 
be read in conjunction with it. The full details of the certification process and protocol are contained within the 
Standard.

This document helps in the understanding of each requirement of the Standard and identifies methods of 
compliance.

Examples are given to explain the type of documents, procedures and level of detail that would be required by a 
certification auditor.

The contents of the guideline are designed to help interpret the Standard across all food sectors; however, the exact 
requirements for any particular product, process or site will be specific to that industry and situation. Users of the 
guideline are therefore cautioned not to rely solely on the information provided here, but also to reconfirm needs 
on a product-by-product basis. Both legislative and voluntary safety requirements change frequently, highlighting 
the need for regular checks of precise requirements.

While adherence to the guideline does not specifically form part of the requirement to achieve certification to the 
Standard (i.e. it does not form part of the audit requirements), companies will need to demonstrate that they have 
taken account of the topics addressed within this guideline. Examples are given as points to consider but should 
always be used in the correct context relevant to the business. Practices should be able to withstand challenge by an 
auditor and be in line with good industry practices.

Achieving a particular requirement is based on evidence collected, observations made during the audit, and on 
the procedures expected within that industry sector. The level of non-conformity assigned by an auditor against a 
requirement of the Standard is an objective judgement with respect to severity and risk. It is based on the evidence 
seen during the audit and independently verified by the certification body management.

Certification to the Standard
Why is certification required?
Certification to the Standard was developed to establish a common standard for food safety and product quality 
management. It allows brand owners to demonstrate control and satisfy legal responsibility for products and 
consumer safety, as well as reducing audit duplication for manufacturers. The Standard has become a benchmark for 
best practice and is recognised worldwide by brand owners and manufacturers in the supply chain, with more than 
20,000 food companies now certificated to the Standard. The Standard has been developed for manufacturers of 
food; however, certification throughout the supply chain is available through other BRCGS Standards:

• Global Standard Agents and Brokers
• Global Standard Consumer Products
• Ethical Trade and Responsible Sourcing
• Gluten-Free Certification Program Global Standard
• Global Standard Packaging Materials
• Plant-Based Global Standard

First steps to gaining certification
Self-audit or gap analysis
Once the decision has been made by the company to pursue certification to the Standard, the requirements need to 
be understood. The site needs to be assessed with regard to its current status, and areas that need to be improved 
must be identified. This may, for example, relate to the structure of buildings, equipment requirements, the design of 
processes or the documentation and implementation of procedures. The company needs to establish an action plan.

Relevant staff need to understand what is expected. Training courses or further information are available and may be 
useful.

A gap analysis or self-audit needs to be conducted. This could be undertaken in-house; for example, it could be 
incorporated into the company’s internal audit process. However, it may require external resources in the form of 
consultancy expertise, or a pre-assessment may be undertaken by the company’s chosen certification body.

Once the company has reviewed the gaps between the requirements and its current practices, the company’s senior 
management needs to establish a plan to ensure that work is undertaken to fulfil the requirements. This could 
include, for example, updating of policies and procedures, training of staff, capital expenditure for equipment and 
maintenance of the building.

Who undertakes certification audits?
BRCGS does not undertake the audits itself. BRCGS is the Standard owner, documenting the requirements on behalf 
of stakeholders and controlling the operation of the certification scheme. The Standard is written by a committee 
of international representatives, coordinated by BRCGS, including retailers, food industry representatives and 
certification bodies. The BRCGS team then controls how audits are undertaken through the specification of the audit 
protocol and supporting rules and regulations for certification bodies undertaking the certification audits. Monitoring 
of certification bodies is undertaken through independent accreditation – for example, by the United Kingdom 
Accreditation Service (UKAS) or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), operating to internationally 
recognised protocols – and by BRCGS.

Therefore, a BRCGS-approved certification body needs to be selected by the company. There is a worldwide choice 
of such bodies; a list can be found in the BRCGS Directory. Certification bodies need to be appropriately qualified to 
undertake the audit and conform to the company’s and its customers’ requirements.

Cost of audits
Audit costs vary and are set by the individual certification bodies. They may include the expenses of the auditor (e.g. 
travel).

Typically, the audit consists of 2 to 3 days on site, depending on factors such as company size (in terms of staff 
numbers and size of site), the complexity of the manufacturing process, communication difficulties (e.g. language) 
and difficulties during the audit.

A full list of factors is given in the Standard and an audit duration calculator is available on the BRCGS website. In 
addition, time is needed to write up the report – typically 0.5–1 day. As with most purchases, the cost should be 
clearly stated and agreed between the company and the certification body prior to entering into the contract.

FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

Note that certification is a continual process, and it is a feature of the scheme that the certification body has the 
option to visit a certificated company at any stage of certification to ensure that certification principles are being 
upheld. This may arise through the receipt of further information, such as a complaint from a customer of the site, 
and a charge may be made for any subsequent visits or investigations.

A service package fee is payable directly to BRCGS through the certification body for every audit undertaken.

The company also needs to consider investment costs that may be incurred to ensure the company is operating to 
the level required by the Standard, including site standards, training and procedural costs.

When can the audit be undertaken?
The company and the chosen certification body should agree a mutually convenient date for announced audits 
and re-audits to ensure that the company retains ongoing certification. (For certificated sites this may be yearly or 
6-monthly, depending on the grade attained.) The company may wish to choose a date when:

• products that need to be included within the scope of the certificate are being manufactured
• personnel to be involved in the audit process are available.

Ongoing re-audit dates need to be considered since the announced re-audit date will fall between 11 and 12 months 
from the original audit date (or 5 to 6 months from the original audit date if a Grade C or D is obtained, where 
re-audit is required after 6 months).

What to expect on the audit day(s)
The auditor/certification body shall have confirmed to the company the time of arrival on site and may have 
provided a summary of the audit schedule. The duration of the audit, although planned in advance, will depend on 
the activities on the day, but it may be shortened if a site is well-organised and information provided in advance as 
requested by the certification body.

The audit consists of the following activities:

• Opening meeting, to be attended by all relevant company personnel (including the most senior production or 
operations manager on site), to confirm:
• the scope and process of the audit
• highlight any key timings; for example, when specific activities will be completed
• any staff who will need to be available to discuss specific aspects of the site operations
• documents that need to be provided
• any logistics, such as rooms for on-site activities, availability of protective clothing, etc.

• Review of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) or product safety plan documentation (where a 
site has multiple HACCP or product safety plans each will be reviewed).

• Production and storage area audits – it is normal for the auditor to enter production early in the audit, as this 
provides a clear understanding of the production processes. During the course of the audit, the auditor will need 
to visit production on multiple occasions; for example, to audit different activities as they occur.

• Document review.
• Vertical audits, traceability exercises and the checks of associated records and documentation.
• Final review of findings by the auditor(s) – preparation for the closing meeting.
• Closing meeting – to review audit findings with the company.

The auditor will need to see the manufacturing process in operation around the site, checking and challenging 
the operation of the company’s procedures. The auditor will check policies, procedures and records for objective 
evidence that requirements are being met, will ask for specific details and will speak to a variety of staff. After the

audit, the auditor will require some quiet time to write up evidence and collate details of non-conformities, in 
preparation for the closing meeting with the company, where the audit is summed up and details of the findings, 
including non-conformities, are given.

Audits – is there anything different?
Issue 9 of the Standard includes three different audit options:

• announced on-site audit
• announced blended audit
• unannounced on-site audit.

Announced audits (with mandatory 1 in 3 unannounced)
Due to the added confidence provided by unannounced audits, the GFSI Benchmark Version 2020 introduced a new 
requirement for certificated sites to have at least 1 unannounced audit every 3 years, even where they have opted 
to be part of the announced audit programme. Therefore, this requirement has been added to the announced audit 
protocol.

For sites that have not previously been certificated to a GFSI Standard, the certification body will agree which year 
within the first 3 years of certification will be unannounced, thereafter the unannounced audit will normally occur 
once every 3 years, unless the site opts into the voluntary unannounced programme (see below).

The remaining aspects of the announced audit programme remain unchanged from Issue 8.

The announced, on-site audit programme (including the mandatory unannounced audit every 3 years) remains 
available to all sites. Full details can be found in the Standard (Part III, section 2).

Blended announced audits
With the evolving role of technology in the supply chain, auditing activity is adapting to incorporate remote 
assessment elements into the process, with the overall aim of evaluating evidence objectively, to determine 
the extent to which the audit criteria are being fulfilled. Introduction of the blended audit option provides an 
opportunity for sites to engage with the auditor using information and communications technology (ICT).

The blended audit has several stages:

• it commences with a risk assessment, completed by the certification body, to confirm the feasibility of an 
ICT remote audit at the site (i.e. to determine if the audit objectives can be achieved using remote ICT audit 
techniques)

• a remote audit of documents, such as procedures and records
• an on-site audit of production and storage, including any aspects of documentation which could not be audited 

remotely.

The blended audit option is only available for the announced audit programme.

It is not available for initial audits (i.e. the first BRCGS audit at the site, which must be completed as a full on-site 
audit); however, subsequent audits can be completed using the blended audit option.

The significance of this audit option resides in its ability to offer flexibility in achieving the audit outcome by using 
ICT to conduct the document and record review parts of the audit.

Full details on the blended audit option are provided in the Standard (Part III, section 3).

ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

Unannounced audits
In this audit option all of the certification and recertification audits are unannounced (unlike the announced audit 
option discussed above, where only one audit every 3 years is unannounced).

The option to undertake the unannounced audit scheme provides companies with an opportunity to demonstrate 
their confidence in their systems and procedures, to the extent that they are willing to subject these to unannounced 
scrutiny.

Companies may thereby gain a competitive advantage with their customers, who are given an opportunity to review 
suppliers’ risk ratings. Customers may view suppliers in the unannounced audit scheme more favourably, depending 
on performance, and they may reduce the frequency of their own customer audits as a result.

The unannounced audit scheme is voluntary and the decision to participate in the scheme rests with the certificated 
company. To opt into the scheme, companies must notify their certification body of their intention within the first 3 
months following a qualifying audit; after this period only the announced scheme will be available.

The grading criteria will be as for the normal audit. Successful completion of the audit will result in the awarding of 
certification Grade AA+, A+, B+, C+ or D+, where the plus symbol indicates an unannounced audit, and this grade 
will appear on the certificate. This certificate will supersede the existing certificate.

While it may be accepted that the company would need to ensure that arrangements such as facilities to undertake 
meetings and review documentation are made available at short notice, an unannounced audit should not affect 
the logistics of how an audit is undertaken, and should be approached in the same way by both the auditor and the 
company. The company should consider the requirements for contingency plans in the event of documents, such 
as personnel records, being kept in locked cupboards and the nominated key holder being off site (e.g. through the 
provision of spare keys).

Issue 9 of the Standard provides an unannounced audit option, where all aspects of the Standard are audited on an 
unannounced visit to the site. Full details of the unannounced audit scheme can be found in Part III, section 4 of the 
Standard.

Explanation of terms
Within the Standard there are some specific terms and language used, and a good starting point for interpreting the 
Standard is to be familiar with these terms and their context. A full glossary is given in Appendix 1.

Annual frequency
Many requirements in the Standard refer to an annual frequency for the completion of, for example, internal audits 
or specific tasks. The aim of this specification is to ensure that the tasks are completed within a 12-month period 
since the last occasion when the activity was completed (e.g. that the test of the system is completed every 12 
months).

Please note that there is a difference of 23 months between a test being completed in January of one year, and a 
subsequent test occurring in December of the following year, which would not meet the requirement for an annual 
frequency.

Appropriate
A number of clauses within the Standard refer to the need to fulfil requirements ‘where appropriate’. ‘Appropriate’ 
is defined as suitable for a particular condition or occasion, and requirements shall be met where it is an industry 
requirement or it is justified to do so.

A number of the requirements specify appropriate timescales, appropriate personnel etc. , and thus contain a level 
of judgement. They are designed to provide a degree of flexibility to ensure the operation of policies or procedures 
that are right for the organisation and the risks associated with the specific products.

Documented procedures
In many instances, the Standard specifically states that requirements shall be satisfied by documented procedures, 
processes, plans or records; in others, this is implied. However, the definition in the Standard glossary (e.g. 
‘procedure’) clearly indicates that a documented system is required, as the company needs to be able to 
demonstrate that systems are in place and working consistently, and that documents are available for reference 
when required.

Any policies and documents must be written in sufficient detail to satisfy their purpose and must reflect the 
activities that happen in practice.

These documents can be hard copy (i.e. paper-based) or electronic.

Fundamental requirements
The Standard contains certain requirements that have been designated as ‘fundamental’. These are marked with 
the word ‘FUNDAMENTAL’ and denoted with the following symbol: . These requirements relate to systems that 
are crucial to the establishment and operation of an effective food quality and safety operation. The requirements 
deemed fundamental are:

• Senior management commitment and continual improvement (1.1)
• The food safety plan – HACCP (2)
• Internal audits (3.4)
• Management of suppliers of raw materials and packaging (3.5.1)
• Corrective and preventive actions (3.7)
• Traceability (3.9)
• Layout, product flow and segregation (4.3)
• Housekeeping and hygiene (4.11)
• Management of allergens (5.3)
• Control of operations (6.1)
• Labelling and pack control (6.2)
• Training: raw-material handling, preparation, processing, packing and storage areas (7.1).

A lack of focus on a fundamental requirement may result in certification not being granted.

HACCP, food safety plan, prerequisites and critical control points
Specific terms (such as prerequisites or critical control points) are drawn from global terminology to describe 
expectations. Sites are not required to adopt the specific terminology used in the Standard. Alternative terminology 
may therefore be acceptable, providing it is evident that all the requirements have been fully met. For example, 
legislative requirements in the US (detailed in the Food Safety Modernization Act) use different terminology but 
still incorporate all the requirements of the Standard.

Risk assessment
Some clauses within the Standard refer to risk assessments being the basis for developing appropriate control 
procedures, such as establishing a frequency for monitoring a control point. The underlying principle is to 
demonstrate that potential hazards have been considered by the site, and that relevant controls are applied.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

12   brcgs.com

Risk assessment is typically defined as a systematic process of identifying the hazards that may be involved in a 
proposed product or process, determining their impact on food safety, authenticity, legality or quality, and designing 
an appropriate control or procedure to minimise the risk of problems occurring.

During the course of the certification audit, the auditor will require evidence of these risk assessments, including 
how they were completed and evidence that the controls are justified and can stand up to robust challenge. Where 
risk assessment demonstrates that further action is not required, it is important that this is also documented, with a 
description of the justification.

Risk assessments do not need to be long, complicated documents; they must, however, demonstrate that all 
relevant aspects have been assessed. For example, they could be documents that identify the hazard, the risk 
of its occurrence and, where appropriate, the controls used or introduced to manage the risk; alternatively, this 
information may be incorporated within established procedures.

The Standard does not prescribe a method for completing risk assessments. Sites are free to use their preferred 
techniques, which may include relevant electronic or physical tools, and there are many guidelines available (for 
example, the ISO 31000 Risk Management Guidelines). In many cases, industry best practice, where known and 
available, will help meet this requirement.

A risk assessment course is available from BRCGS Performance Enhancement and through the global network of 
approved training providers. More information is available from the training pages on the BRCGS website.

‘Shall’ versus ‘may’
The style of the Standard is generally one of guidance, to allow companies to ensure that all aspects of control 
have been considered, so that thorough and comprehensive policies and procedures may be developed. In some 
instances the Standard requires that criteria must be included within a policy or procedure, and this is generally 
covered by the term ‘shall’. If any of the points included are not covered adequately, a non-conformity will result.

However, there are also a number of clauses that provide examples or guidelines, generally preceded by the words 
‘may include’ or ‘should’. This information is provided as guidance for incorporation in company policies and 
procedures. It is the responsibility of the company to ensure that the auditor is satisfied that the system in place is 
appropriate.

Clause 3.11.1 shows an example of both usages:

‘The company shall have procedures designed to report and effectively manage incidents and potential emergency 
situations that impact food safety, authenticity, legality or quality. This shall include consideration of contingency 
plans to maintain product safety, authenticity, legality and quality. Incidents may include …’

Statements of intent
Each main section or subsection of the requirements in the Standard begins with a statement of intent (SOI). This 
sets out the expected outcome of compliance with the requirements of that section. This forms part of the audit 
and all companies must comply with the statements of intent. Statements of intent have tinted backgrounds, as 
shown here.

Below the statements of intent in the tables are more specific and detailed requirements (clauses) that, if applied 
appropriately, will help to achieve the stated objective of the requirement. All of the requirements and the 
statements of intent shall form part of the audit and must be complied with in order for a certificate to be issued.

Validation
Validation is defined as obtaining evidence that a control measure (or combination of measures), if properly 
implemented, is capable of controlling a hazard to a specified outcome. Validation activity is completed before 
the controls are introduced or when changes are expected (e.g. new products, new processes or new equipment). 
Validation might include:

• document and data review – previous test results, industry data, codes of practice and legislation may all contain 
useful information

• experiments/testing – consider tests on the product or factory environment that will demonstrate control (e.g. 
worst-case-scenario tests, final-product tests)

• challenge studies – for example, microbiological tests to establish whether a micro-organism of concern can grow 
in the product using the relevant time/conditions

• modelling – a number of predictive tools are available.

Several worked examples of validation can be found in Codex guideline CXG 69-2008, available on the 
Codex Alimentarius guidelines page of the FAO website.

A validation and verification course is available from BRCGS Performance Enhancement and through the global 
network of approved training providers. More information is available from the BRCGS website.

Verification
Verification is defined as obtaining evidence, on a predetermined and ongoing basis, that a control is operating 
within the correct parameters. Verification requires the application of methods, procedures, tests or evaluations, in 
addition to monitoring, to determine whether the control measure is operating as intended. Verification activities 
may include:

• audits – both internal and third-party
• review of records (e.g. records of the monitoring of temperatures and times, or other records completed during 

production) to confirm results were within expected limits and consider any trends
• corrective action review
• test results – depending on the control being verified, these might include final products, raw materials, swabs, 

rapid tests, etc.

A validation and verification course is available from BRCGS Performance Enhancement and through the global 
network of approved training providers. More information is available from the BRCGS website.

Monitoring
Monitoring is defined as conducting a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether a 
control measure is within acceptable limits (e.g. temperature checks, metal detector checks, test weights).

Colour-coding the requirements
The audit process gives specific emphasis to the practical implementation of food safety procedures within the 
factory and general good manufacturing practices. Auditing these areas therefore forms a significant proportion of 
the audit.

As an aid to this process, the requirements within the Standard have been colour-coded. This colour-coding shows 
the activities that would usually be audited as part of the assessment of the production areas and facilities, and 
those that would form part of an audit of records, systems and documentation.

which must be audited when the auditor is on site.

Guidance on the requirements
1 Senior management commitment

1.1 Senior management commitment and continual improvement

Fundamental
The site’s senior management shall demonstrate that they are fully committed to the 
implementation of the requirements of the Global Standard Food Safety and to processes which 
facilitate continual improvement of food safety, quality management, and the site’s food safety and 
quality culture.

Interpretation

A fundamental factor in the management of product safety is the product safety and quality culture which prevails at 
the site; that is, the shared attitudes, values and beliefs relating to the importance of product safety, the confidence 
in the product safety processes used at the site, and the systems available to report and act on any concerns relating 
to product safety.

For this culture to flourish and for the importance of product safety to be understood by all members of staff, it is 
vital that product safety is led from the top of the organisation. This includes not only the official company policies 
and procedures, the KPIs or targets the company challenges itself to meet, but also the culture which prevails and 
the direction the company takes. This leadership should also ensure that the necessary commitment, support and 
resources are available.

Without this culture and management commitment, it is very unlikely that the Standard could be consistently 
applied or that the customer assurance provided by certification could be honoured. There are requirements within 
the Standard that need to be understood and applied by most functions within the organisation, from purchasing 
to personnel and from maintenance to production. Experience has shown that only where the most senior 
management are committed to the processes can this level of involvement be achieved consistently. Leadership 
behaviours, tendencies and management practices all influence the culture of safety, increasing the likelihood of the 
site adhering to good practice.

Senior managers should therefore be fully engaged in the implementation of and ongoing compliance with the 
Standard.

Continual improvement is also an important principle of the Standard. This is not a question of how many non-
conformities the site received in consecutive audits, although if the same non-conformity repeatedly occurred at 
every audit, that may indicate a wider concern. Continual improvement asks whether the company uses ongoing 
opportunities to improve relevant aspects of its ways of working. There are many clauses within the Standard that 
point towards this principle and provide these opportunities. For example:

• Plans to develop and continually improve product safety and quality culture of the organisation (see clause 1.1.2)
• Review processes and meetings – for example, senior leadership management meetings (see clause 1.1.4)
• Data capture and trending – for example, the trending of complaints information, so that significant negative 

trends can be investigated and improvements made (see clause 3.10.2)
• Processes for remaining up to date with emerging issues, legislation and good practice (see clause 1.1.8)
• The role of preventive action (see clause 1.1.12 and the clauses within section 3.7).

Clause Requirements
1.1.1 The site shall have a documented policy which states the site’s intention to meet its 

obligation to produce safe, legal and authentic products to the specified quality, and its 
responsibility to its customers. This shall:

• be signed by the person with overall responsibility for the site
• be communicated to all staff
• include commitment to continuously improve the site’s food safety and quality culture.

Interpretation Documented policy

The site’s policy must clearly state the overall aims to meet customer requirements, 
including the provision of safe, authentic products of the quality desired by the customer. 
The policy will also highlight the site’s intention to improve product safety and quality 
culture on a continuous basis, which, as discussed (for example, in the interpretation for 
the statement of intent and importantly in clause 1.1.2), is fundamental in the consistent 
application of product safety practices. The policy is designed to show the site’s intention, 
so that all staff can work towards this common goal.

Authenticity of products means ensuring that all products sold or purchased are of 
the nature, substance and quality expected. This applies not just to product claims, but 
includes all products and raw materials with the assurance that they meet the specification. 
Authenticity is defined in the glossary.

The policy must be signed by the person with overall responsibility for the audited site, 
to demonstrate the commitment at senior management at site level. Where the policy is a 
group- or company-wide statement, the site management should endorse it; for example, by 
countersigning it.

The policy statement is only a summary and can usually be expressed in a single page. 
Although it does not need to be dated, it must be current and should therefore be updated 
when significant policies or senior management change. The policy forms the foundation 
for the site’s ways of working and the auditor will expect to see how the site management 
ensure staff understanding and engagement. This may include:

• communication to staff (e.g. through display on noticeboards, inclusion in the induction 
process, availability on the company intranet, and the use of appropriate languages where 
the local language is not the first language of all employees. The use of dual languages 
may improve and speed up understanding and action)

• inclusion of all staff, including temporary and contract staff, in the communication and 
engagement processes.

Clause Requirements
1.1.2 The site’s senior management shall define and maintain a clear plan for the development 

and continuing improvement of a food safety and quality culture. The plan shall include 
measures needed to achieve a positive culture change.

This shall include:

• defined activities involving all sections of the site that have an impact on product safety. 
As a minimum, these activities shall be designed around:
• clear and open communication on product safety
• training
• feedback from employees
• the behaviours required to maintain and improve product safety processes
• performance measurement of activities related to the safety, authenticity, legality and 

quality of products
• an action plan indicating how the activities will be undertaken and measured, and the 

intended timescales
• a review of the effectiveness of completed activities.

The plan shall be reviewed and updated at least annually, at a minimum.

Interpretation Food safety and quality culture

Analysis of the root causes of many non-conformities shows that a proactive, positive 
product safety and quality culture (hereafter referred to as culture) within a company can 
make all the difference in the effectiveness of the food safety and quality plan and its 
consistent implementation throughout the site. Culture must be led by senior management 
and ‘felt’ throughout the organisation, so that all aspects of the business are informed and 
involved. It is important to understand that the culture plan is unlikely to be successful if 
it is viewed as simply a technical function. It will require the input and commitment of the 
site’s senior leadership team and may also align with several teams around the business; for 
example, with human resources (HR) or personnel management activities.

Culture can be challenging. It relies not just on measurables and specifics but an ethos and 
values felt by people at all levels of the site. The size and complexity (or simplicity) of the 
site should not be a barrier to a successful culture.

The site is required to develop, implement and maintain a clear plan or programme for 
developing and improving its culture. Such a plan should be based on the nature of the 
organisation, and dependent on its size, seasonality and the overall aims it has identified 
as important for its own culture. The clause does not prescribe the exact mechanisms that 
must be used; this is to allow the site flexibility to develop systems that are effective within 
its specific ways of working, and its current prevailing culture. It does, however, highlight the 
minimum scope of the plan.

The plan will need to consider the measures needed to achieve the intended positive 
culture change.

Interpretation 
continued

The plan does not need to be annual. A strategic plan could, for example, cover 5 years, with 
activities designed to measure current culture, implement changes and assess improvements 
(or where improvement was not evident, a review of why). Some aspects of the plan may 
occur more frequently than others. However, for the plan to be effective, the development 
and improvement of culture will need to be treated as an ongoing and continuous process, 
and the auditor will expect to see evidence that activities are being completed each year 
during which the plan is designed to operate. It is not acceptable to design a 5-year plan 
where all of the activities are completed within the final year.

Regardless of the intended length or lifetime of the plan, it is important that it remains 
relevant and up to date. The site will therefore need to ensure that it is regularly reviewed 
and updated. At a minimum there must be an annual review.

A wide range of activities could be incorporated into a culture development plan, some of 
which the company may already be conducting. As a minimum the Standard requires:

• a clear and open communication on product safety
• training
• feedback from employees
• behaviour changes required to maintain and improve product safety processes
• performance measurement on product safety, authenticity, legality and quality related 

activities.

However, note that culture is not simply a matter of introducing another policy, but on 
developing attitudes and a positive approach to product safety and product safety processes. 
For example:

• Ease of movement of product safety information between different levels and sections of 
the site can be an indication of a good culture. However, a formal communication policy is 
not likely to affect company culture, unless the site has considered what is communicated, 
in what format. For example, if all communication is finance-related and lacks information 
on product safety, then staff may mistakenly believe that product safety is not important, 
due to its lack of communication. Instead, regular, open and clear communication, 
involving all personnel, is needed, including expectations, benefits, product safety 
successes as well as deviations from what is expected or acceptable.

• Training and staff development (e.g. the use of annual staff reviews and one-to-ones) 
should have a number of aims beyond just training the process or procedure (e.g. 
awareness of food safety issues, management techniques, and development of positive 
behaviours and staff development).

• Feedback from employees (e.g. staff surveys), focusing on values and culture, can provide 
useful information on current mindset and culture, impact of recent initiatives and 
preferred direction of travel. Feedback mechanisms also provide an opportunity to identify 
and address staff concerns.

Interpretation • Consideration of the behaviour changes needed to improve culture – the site should 
choose relevant behaviours that will have a positive impact on product safety. These 
relevant behaviours may be identified simply by a manager’s knowledge of the site, or 
identified through the results of a site survey (such as the BRCGS Culture Excellence 
Module), or by considering the many indicators (or artefacts) of the behaviours, beliefs or 
attitudes that exist at a site. These can provide an indication of the prevailing culture and 
could be used in this part of the plan. An artefact of culture is described as an existing 
product safety activity that is not culture itself, but is indicative of the site’s prevailing 
culture (i.e. the site’s attitudes towards the value or importance of a specific product 
safety activity, and its compliance with that activity, is often indicative of the culture of 
the site). These behaviours or attitudes are often identifiable by the site and useful in 
the maintenance and improvement of product safety culture and can therefore be built 
into the culture improvement plan. Many fundamental product safety processes could be 
considered artefacts of the culture; for example:
• food safety policy
• objective setting and management review
• food safety in management meetings
• food safety resources
• risk awareness (e.g. for HACCP development)
• effectiveness of corrective and preventive actions
• internal audits
• training.
Remember that these activities are not the culture themselves; they are artefacts – 
indicators of the prevalent product safety behaviours at the site.

• Performance measurement – this is different from clause 1.1.3. There, the objectives are 
used to directly improve food safety, whereas the aim of this clause is to consider the 
impact of the results and learnings on product safety culture. For example, if an objective 
is always met, or always missed, or the objective remains unchanged every year, this may 
indicate a site attitude towards the objectives and provides site leadership with an attitude 
to focus on. In other words, is the site attitude to develop and continuously improve food 
safety using the objectives as one of the tools, or are the objectives set only to meet the 
requirements of the Standard?

Along with the activities, the culture plan must also include information indicating how 
activities will be undertaken, the intended timescales for completion, plans for measurement 
(including results from previous activities) and a review of the effectiveness of completed 
activities.

This information should be used to review the plan to ensure it remains up to date and 
relevant for the site. It also has the bonus of creating a history of improvements and impacts. 
This information can be used, for example, to train new employees, inspire existing staff and 
further inform the types of activity/implementation that are most effective at the site and 
those which are more likely to struggle.

Culture is often considered to be subjective and therefore difficult to audit. It must be 
emphasised that auditors are not expected to audit ‘food safety culture’ of the site, but the 
evidence of compliance with the requirements of the clause. The auditor will therefore 
examine evidence of conformity with this requirement during both the audit of the facilities 
and the documentation audit. This will be achieved using a number of auditing techniques; 
for example:

• a review of the documented plan and records – is it complete, does it contain all the 
relevant information, how were the activities and objectives set, are the monitoring and 
review processes operating correctly and have they been used to review and update the 
plan to ensure it remains relevant for the site?

• discussion with senior management on the development and implementation of the plan 
(refer to clause 1.1.11).

• discussions may be conducted across all levels of personnel on an informal basis. The 
auditor would expect to find an awareness of food safety culture, how individuals can 
impact it, and the company’s objectives.

• evidence of the site completing the activities in its action plan.
• timescales and evidence that they have been met.
• monitoring and review processes, and results from previous activities.

BRCGS provides a number of services that can support a site’s development of its culture 
plan, including:

• an additional voluntary module in product safety culture excellence which helps sites 
measure the current culture and identify areas for improvement.

• a guideline on product safety culture which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or 
viewed online at BRCGS Participate.

• a training course explaining culture and its implementation.

Non-conformities To ensure expectations are understood relating to compliance with clause 1.1.2, its consistent 
application at certificated sites, and assessment during audits, BRCGS has trained auditors 
and certification bodies to apply the following non-conformities, where sites are non-
compliant:

• Major non-conformity  Where the site does not have a documented plan for food safety 
and quality culture. In this context a plan is more than a short statement of intent, but is 
documentation incorporating all of the requirements of the clause.

• Minor non-conformity  Where a documented plan exists, but:
• is of poor quality (e.g. lacks detail such as timescales for completion or clear action 

plans)
• does not cover all the relevant areas or staff
• is not fully implemented (e.g. some activities are not implemented or are not completed 

to a predefined schedule).

The final bullet point in the clause requires sites to undertake a review of the effectiveness 
of completed activities. However, it is possible that this review of the success of the 
programme would not always be implemented in year 1 (since a review cannot be completed 
until there are activities to review). Therefore non-compliance with this bullet point is not 
considered a non-conformity at the site’s initial audit, but will be assessed from the site’s 
second audit to the Standard onwards.

The site is expected to complete corrective action, root cause analysis and preventive action 
plans in accordance with section 2.3 of the audit protocol prior to certification, and any non-
conformity will be included in the calculation of the site’s grade.

Example Food safety and quality culture plan

The company decides to implement a culture plan. Based on the requirements of the 
Standard it identifies six key areas to include:

• Enhanced training  Beyond just managing critical control points (CCPs), to an 
understanding of the reasons for the current product safety processes and involving staff 
in corrective actions.

• Communications  Regular staff updates in addition to the traditional internal message 
boards. Updates are used to communicate production, incidences of non-conforming 
product, customer complaints and their corrective actions, and improvements in product 
quality. They also focus on company strategy and product safety objectives.

• A clear feedback process  To initiate communication ‘up’ to management, so that 
communication is not seen just as management ‘telling staff’.

• Recognition  Management instigates ‘employee of the month’ awards as rewards for 
successful process improvement ideas.

• Behaviours to maintain and improve product safety  The site identifies two areas it would 
like to focus on:
• Previously the site had developed reporting and whistleblowing systems which allow 

staff to feed back concerns relating to product safety, in accordance with clauses 1.1.6 
and 1.2.3 of the Standard. However, staff feedback has identified a lack of use of the 
systems due to:
• a lack of encouragement to report errors and product safety concerns
• a lack of trust, and a feeling that it is not safe or comfortable to report problems
• a belief that problems will not be taken seriously or that nothing will improve.
Senior management therefore decides to include staff reporting and concerns about 
the current system in the culture improvement plan, and look for ways to build trust and 
encourage use.

• Internal audits are an extremely useful site-based tool for monitoring and improving 
systems. However, the site notices that many departments undervalue the audit 
programme, with several reports reflecting a negative attitude towards the programme. 
Senior management also notes that internal audits require effort and resource to 
complete robustly and effectively, which have not always been available. In fact, at a 
previous management meeting the senior leadership had considered the potential to 
further minimise the internal audit programme (e.g. by resorting to tick-box exercises, 
reducing the number of audits or auditors, and completing the minimum activity 
possible, rather than reviewing the actual risks).
The culture plan therefore includes activities to build belief in, and use of, the internal 
audit programme, starting with education about the programme and its importance, 
training for new internal auditors, communication of audit results (positives as well as 
non-conformity), using the management review programme to consider learnings from 
the programme which can further benefit the site.

• KPIs  The site’s quality KPIs have remained constant for a prolonged period. The site 
decides to use its annual customer reviews as an opportunity to review the quality KPIs to 
establish their continuing appropriateness.

Example 
continued

To ensure that the activities proceed according to the plan (and in accordance with the 
Standard), the site management:

• assigns timescales for the start of each activity
• nominates leaders for each activity with responsibility to lead the activities identified
• makes progress against the product safety culture plan an agenda item at the quarterly 

senior management team meetings
• schedules a follow-up staff survey for 12 months’ time which will specifically be used to 

assess the effectiveness of the planned activities
• sets a review date for the complete plan.

1.1.3 The site’s senior management shall ensure that clear objectives are defined to maintain 
and improve the safety, authenticity, legality and quality of products manufactured, in 
accordance with the food safety and quality policy and this Standard. These objectives shall 
be:

• documented and include targets or clear measures of success
• clearly communicated to all staff
• monitored and results reported at least quarterly to site senior management and all staff.

Interpretation Food safety and quality objectives

Senior management must set objectives concerning food safety, authenticity, legality and 
quality that help to achieve the stated policy (see clause 1.1.1).

The objectives must be communicated so that staff understand what is required from 
them. The setting of these objectives also helps the allocation of suitable budgets and 
resources. Auditors will look for evidence that the objectives are in place and have been 
communicated.

Good objectives are usually:

• Specific  Objectives should be clear and directly related to the site’s aims or goals for 
product safety and quality.

• Measurable  Objectives should be measurable so that the site can assess progress.
• Achievable  Targets that stretch the company are acceptable but it is important that they 

are realistic and that sufficient resources will be available.
• Relevant  Objectives should be designed to maintain and improve product safety and 

quality.
• Time-bound  Objectives can be long-term (e.g. throughout the period of certification) or 

shorter-term (e.g. within the next 3 months); however, the timescales or deadlines should 
be clear to enable the site to review progress and, if necessary, amend activities.

There are many examples of objectives that could be included. For example:

• reductions in customer complaints, non-conforming products and/or customer rejections 
or returns

• reductions in audit failures or audit non-conformities – include both internal and external 
audits, but ensure that all audits are still completed to a thorough, rigorous quality

• improved product safety training
• improvements to the management of product authenticity
• increases to product testing.

In each of these examples it would be necessary for the site to consider how to make the 
objective specific and measurable (as discussed above); for example, 10% fewer customer 
complaints to be achieved by year end.

Objectives associated with product authenticity are likely to be formed differently; for 
example, they may be linked to:

• improvements to the traceability systems or traceability testing (section 3.9)
• evolution of product monitoring processes such as product testing (section 5.6)
• outcomes from the vulnerability assessment (section 5.4)
• updates to the supplier approval mechanisms and the ongoing monitoring of suppliers 

(section 3.5).

A similar situation exists for objectives associated with legality, as these will also need to be 
formed differently from those commonly used for product safety. For example, where there 
is proposed legislation in the region where the company operates, then possible targets may 
relate to ensuring that relevant staff are trained in a timely manner.

Progress against targets must be reviewed and reported to senior management at least 
quarterly. It may, for example, be included in management meetings (e.g. those scheduled 
for clause 1.1.4), or it may be the subject of a separate review or included in a report to 
management. Auditors will look for documented evidence of communication and the 
quarterly progress review.

The Standard also requires communication to staff (including all employees and agency-
supplied staff). The Standard is not prescriptive on the methods of communication used 
to meet this clause. For example, any of the following could be used: meetings, briefings, 
cascades, huddles, electronic media (e.g. email), and company noticeboards.

Independent sites or facilities that are part of a large group with company-wide objectives 
can adopt the company-wide objectives, but are required to ‘own’ the objectives and carry 
out the implementation, monitoring, review etc. at site level.

1.1.4 Management review meetings attended by the site’s senior management shall be undertaken 
at appropriate planned intervals, annually at a minimum, to review the site performance 
against the Standard and objectives set in clause 1.1.3. The review process shall include the 
evaluation of:

• previous management review action plans and timeframes
• the results of internal, second-party and/or third-party audits
• any objectives that have not been met, to understand the underlying reasons. This 

information shall be used when setting future objectives and to facilitate continual 
improvement

• any customer complaints and the results of any customer feedback
• any incidents (including both recalls and withdrawals), corrective actions, out-of-

specification results and non-conforming materials
• the effectiveness of the systems for HACCP, food defence and authenticity, and the food 

safety and quality culture plan
• resource requirements.

Records of the meeting shall be documented and used to revise the objectives, thereby 
encouraging continual improvement. The decisions and actions agreed within the review 
process shall be effectively communicated to appropriate staff, and actions implemented 
within agreed timescales.

Interpretation Senior management review

The purpose of the management review meeting is to take an overview of the food safety 
systems. It should therefore be a full and detailed examination of what has happened and 
what should happen in future. It is not the ongoing management of an issue or concern 
(although the agenda may include a review of any such concerns) and it is not just incident/
non-conforming product management (processes for these activities are covered in the 
relevant sections of the Standard; for example, in sections 3.8 and 3.11).

The format of the meeting should reflect company size.

The Standard identifies specific agenda items that must be included within the meeting; 
however, additional relevant subjects should also be included where appropriate. As a 
minimum the meeting agenda should therefore consider:

• minutes of the previous management reviews and actions agreed. For example, the 
previous meeting may have set actions and timescales for their completion; however, 
if actions were not completed on schedule or have failed to be effective, further 
investigation and actions will be required

• what has been achieved or not been achieved and progress against objectives (see 
clause 1.1.3); for example:
• if an objective has been met the site can consider future targets based on achievements 

to date
• if an objective has not been met the site can consider why. This can be very informative 

and allows future objectives (or other actions such as the product safety culture plan) 
to focus on areas where relevant, achievable actions can take place. This review need 
not be exhaustive (such as a full root cause analysis) but the site should be able to 
understand why objectives were not met. The outcome would not be preventive action 
but continual improvement, allowing the site to refine its future targets

• internal, second-party and/or third-party audits, and subsequent actions. As a minimum 
the Standard requires a summary of the results from the internal audit programme to be 
reviewed at these meetings (see clause 3.4.3). This provides two opportunities for the 
senior management team:
• a review of non-conformities, corrective actions, root causes and preventive actions, 

with a focus on any outstanding concerns or additional actions required (individual 
issues should have been identified and acted upon at the time they were identified and 
where necessary, escalated to the management team during the year)

• review of the overall performance and key trends should facilitate continuous 
improvement (e.g. changes to the frequency of auditing particular areas, training needs or 
suggestions for improvements or further developments of the internal audit programme)

Similarly, second- or third-party activities (including customer audits, regulatory authority 
visits) could be summarised to facilitate further discussion and identify any actions or 
improvements that need to be made

• progress against the product safety and quality culture plan and the effectiveness of 
completed actions

• product safety incidents, complaints, out-of-specification results or non-conforming 
products, to ensure these have been fully actioned, to assess any trends and identify any 
additional follow-up actions or improvements needed as a result of these incidents and 
non-conforming situations

• the management and effectiveness of product safety systems such as HACCP, food 
defence and product authenticity, along with any existing or emerging issues relating to 
these topics

• identification of targets and areas of improvement for the coming year
• changes to resource requirements.

It is important that sufficient information is presented to the meeting to enable a full and 
meaningful discussion and, where appropriate, actions to be agreed.

Senior management is considered to consist of managers who have the authority to 
make decisions on food safety objectives and/or the provision of adequate human and 
financial resources. The management team would usually include the site manager and 
those managers responsible for production, technical operations, purchasing, engineering 
and human resources. For large, multi-site organisations the management review meeting 
may include head office representatives, but this decision should be driven by the senior 
management on site. It may also include representatives from any departments responsible 
for specific product safety activities or for specific agenda items.

Good practice is to ensure that the meeting is put into all attendees’ diaries sufficiently early 
to maximise attendance and that agendas and papers are circulated in advance.

The auditor will be looking for evidence that, for each agenda item, sufficient information 
has been provided to allow an informed discussion to take place leading to appropriate 
action plans. This may be demonstrated through a review of the inputs to the meeting, 
minutes of the discussion of the items and, where necessary, agreed action plans. To 
demonstrate that, for example, senior management has reviewed the management of the 
HACCP system, the minutes should contain a general summary of the HACCP review 
meeting (see section 2.12.3) and a record of its outcomes (these would be inputs into 
the management review meeting), together with any actions requested during the senior 
management meeting (i.e. outputs of management review meeting).

One of the outputs from the meeting is a review of performance against the objectives 
(clause 1.1.3) and the establishment of new or amended targets and objectives for the 
following year. This should be clearly documented within the minutes of the meeting.

The outcomes from the review meeting must be communicated to the relevant staff to 
ensure implementation. It should be evident to the auditor how this has been achieved 
(e.g. cascaded through staff briefings or posted on noticeboards). It should also be evident 
that actions are followed up and completed. For example, evidence of completion could 
be added to meeting records, or assessment of actions could be added to the internal audit 
programme.

The Standard requires an annual review, such as a regular annual management review 
meeting. However, it is important that meetings are scheduled correctly and of sufficient 
frequency to maximise the value of the meeting and allow timely actions. Many companies 
opt to make a review or partial review more frequently (e.g. every 6 months or each quarter), 
either addressing all the points in summary (after other review meetings) or addressing 
one or two points in depth in each meeting. The number of meetings and the individual 
agendas should be based on company need, providing all relevant topics are covered within 
the 12-month period. Where meetings are scheduled with a large intervening period (e.g. 
annually) the site needs a process to ensure that any matters needing consideration can 
be completed in a timely fashion; for example, by incorporating them into management 
meeting agendas (see clause 1.1.5).

Special consideration should be given to seasonal and temporary sites to ensure meetings 
occur at an appropriate point in the season and that actions, targets or objectives can be 
completed. Some sites therefore opt for two meetings; for example, one at the start of the 
season, to allow objective setting, and one at the end of the season, when the season’s 
information can be assessed. Alternatively, a management meeting shortly after an external 
audit allows any non-conformities to be included in the discussion and relevant corrective 
actions to be agreed.

All sites should have a predefined schedule so all participants are aware, in advance, of when 
the meetings will take place.

1.1.5 The site shall have a demonstrable meeting programme which enables food safety, 
authenticity, legality and quality issues to be brought to the attention of senior management. 
These meetings shall occur at least monthly.

Interpretation Management meetings

The objective of this clause is to ensure that there is a mechanism that enables the site to 
learn and react to available information from both internal (within the site and/or company) 
and external sources (e.g. wider industry, media, etc), allowing food safety, authenticity, 
legality and quality issues to be raised and discussed at a senior management level within 
the site. The meeting could include, for example:

• review of successes/failures relating to product safety, authenticity, legality and quality and 
the lessons that can be learnt from these

• any ongoing concerns
• review of corrective actions, root causes, preventive actions and the effectiveness of these
• review of information relating to publications, known recalls of similar products, 

information from regulatory authorities, media stories and potential implications/learnings 
for the site. This could include information obtained as a result of activities to comply with 
clause 1.1.8

• overview of KPIs, complaint levels or other relevant metrics.

Meetings will need to include management of a seniority to make decisions, and where 
appropriate, take actions.

Most sites have weekly or monthly management meetings and the inclusion of safety, 
authenticity, legality and quality as an agenda item within this meeting is one way to meet 
the requirements of this clause.

A schedule for the meetings needs to be in place.

Seasonal sites are not expected to have monthly meetings when the site is closed and not 
operating, but scheduling should consider the length of the season and processes to ensure 
that food safety, authenticity, legality and quality issues can be discussed in a timely manner. 
For example, the first meeting could take place shortly before the season begins, with further 
meetings monthly or even weekly throughout the season, and a final meeting at the end of 
the season.

The audit will confirm whether:

• the meetings occur at a defined frequency (e.g. a schedule, diary bookings or agendas)
• previous meetings contained relevant discussions (e.g. agenda and minutes for the 

meetings which clearly state conclusions and any additional actions).

Interpretation

Good practice is to ensure that any decisions and actions agreed are communicated to 
appropriate staff, and that there is a system to check that actions are implemented within 
agreed timescales.

1.1.6 The company shall have a confidential reporting system to enable staff to report concerns 
relating to product safety, authenticity, legality and quality.

The mechanism (e.g. the relevant telephone number) for reporting concerns shall be clearly 
communicated to staff.

The company’s senior management shall have a process for assessing any concerns raised. 
Records of the assessment and, where appropriate, actions taken, shall be documented.

Interpretation Confidential reporting system (whistleblowing)

In 2018 a report from the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners found that reports 
from employees and outside parties are by far the most common method of detecting 
wrongdoing. It is therefore vital that all sites facilitate effective communication methods 
allowing staff to report any concerns. Ideally, this will be achievable using procedures 
developed to meet clause 1.2.3. However, from time to time it may be necessary for 
individuals to report on hazards or infractions anonymously and confidentially (e.g. if a 
staff member felt that a genuine concern raised through other mechanisms, such as those 
covered in clause 1.2.3, had not been adequately addressed), so the site (or company) should 
have a system in place to manage this. Although the aim of the Standard is to ensure these 
reporting systems relate to product safety, authenticity, quality and legality, the company 
may choose to incorporate all staff concerns into the system, and not limit it to concerns 
related to the scope of the Standard.

As a minimum, the system used must ensure that the confidentiality of the employee 
reporting the concern is maintained (i.e. the employee’s identity is not known or released 
to the site or company management) to protect any staff using it, and the confidential and 
anonymous nature of the system should be clear to all staff. An email or telephone call to an 
on-site manager, for example, is unlikely to be anonymous or confidential as the manager is 
likely to know the employee’s email address or recognise their voice. Therefore this would 
not be considered a confidential system.

Many food processors will also have whistleblowing systems established by the brand 
owners and retailers for which it produces. Where this is the case, the site is still required 
to have its own system as affected products may not relate to the specific brand owner. 
Additionally, in some areas, local relevant regulatory authorities will have facilities for 
confidential reports about a site but this also does not mitigate the need for a site (or 
company) to have a system.

As well as gathering information, the site is required to collate and act on it. The auditor 
will expect to see a system in place, and transparency about the content of any reports and 
actions, although not the source of the original concern.

Where possible, sites might consider an independent system that receives and processes 
any concerns raised with appropriate promptness. For example, where quality, safety or 
conformity of the product is at risk, action should be immediate. This might be by using an 
independent consultant or a professional organisation that can act as an intermediary.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation

Where local legal requirements prohibit certain activities around confidentiality or such 
reports, the site will need to ensure the system employed meets these legal requirements. 
This will also be acknowledged by the auditor and compliance with this clause noted within 
the context of the legal framework.

It is not uncommon for larger companies to base the management of their confidential 
reporting systems at head office, rather than at each individual site. This is acceptable and 
the audit process is explained in Appendix 4 of the Standard.

BRCGS operates the independent ‘Tell BRCGS’ facility (available online). This has been 
designed so that BRCGS can receive information from any interested party about the status 
of certificated sites or the certification process. Therefore, when feedback is received, it will 
be investigated and this may, for example, identify the need for a compliance audit at the 
implicated site to ensure that it is operating legally and in compliance with the Standard. 
This is different from the aim of this whistleblowing clause, which is to provide the site/
company management with an opportunity to receive and address any concerns raised 
by employees without the site being subject to an external review. Therefore, a site using 
the Tell BRCGS system without its own confidential reporting system will not achieve the 
intended aim of the clause, although it could be used for situations where an employee has 
tried other site-specific options and is still sufficiently concerned to raise the matter with 
BRCGS.

1.1.7 The company’s senior management shall provide the human and financial resources required 
to produce safe, authentic, legal products to the specified quality and in compliance with the 
requirements of this Standard.

Interpretation Resources

Sites must have sufficient financial and human resources to be able to maintain the food 
safety, authenticity, legality and quality systems.

Although a review of resources forms part of the management review process (clause 1.1.4), 
it should not be restricted to a single annual discussion if there is a need to make changes to 
resource allocation during the course of the year.

As well as looking at the minutes of the management review meeting, auditors will also 
look at the type, number and root causes of non-conformities identified at the audit, as the 
ability of the site to meet the requirements of the Standard will partly demonstrate that the 
appropriate resources and skills are available.

The auditor will examine this requirement during both the audit of the facilities and 
documentation. The auditor will expect the site to demonstrate that it is adequately 
resourcing its product safety, authenticity, legality and quality activities, which may include 
capital expenditure (e.g. for repairs or new equipment), staff levels and staff training.

1.1.8 The company’s senior management shall have a system in place to ensure that the site is 
kept informed of and reviews:

• scientific and technical developments
• industry codes of practice
• new risks to authenticity of raw materials
• all relevant legislation in the country where the product will be sold (where known).

Interpretation Technical knowledge and information

Food safety issues and legislative requirements are constantly changing. The objective of 
this clause is to ensure that sites remain up to date, are able to meet legislation and can 
adapt their food safety systems to protect against new threats. The company must be able 
to demonstrate that it maintains up-to-date knowledge of relevant legislation, scientific and 
technical developments, potential risks to raw materials (e.g. to the authenticity of the raw 
material) and industry codes of practice, such as Codex Alimentarius. Activities to achieve 
this may include:

• membership of a trade association that provides this service
• subscription to a service provider supplying legal updates
• help from government officials or local enforcement offices
• regular review of identified websites covering legislation and standards.

In addition to information relating to food safety, the site must also have a system to obtain 
and review information relating to the authenticity of raw materials and the potential for 
substitution or dilution of the ingredients. This information will, for example, be required to 
demonstrate compliance with clause 5.4.2.

The company needs to demonstrate that it can readily access, either directly or through 
a third party, legislation relating to the product in the country, state or territory where the 
product is sold to the ultimate consumer (if known, or where it can reasonably be expected 
to be sold). Good practice is also to consider the country where the product is manufactured.

The auditor will therefore look for evidence of systematic checking and of the process for 
ensuring the information is transferred into action as necessary.

1.1.9 The site shall have a genuine, original hard copy or electronic version of the current 
Standard available and be aware of any changes to the Standard or protocol that are 
published on the BRCGS website.

Interpretation Availability of a copy of the Standard

The aim of this clause is to ensure the site has easy access to all the relevant requirements 
for compliance and certification to the Standard. The site must therefore have an official 
copy of the Standard available in either paper or electronic form. Either a free or paid-for 
PDF copy of the Standard demonstrates compliance with this requirement. A subscription to 
BRCGS Participate provides an online version of the Standard (and interpretation and other 
guidelines) and therefore also meets this requirement.

The site will also need copies of any additional voluntary modules to which they are 
certificated.

In addition, during the lifetime of the Standard, the BRCGS technical advisory committee 
(TAC) may be asked to:

• review the wording of a requirement in the Standard or audit protocol
• provide an interpretation for a requirement
• rule on the grading of a non-conformity against a clause.

Interpretation 
continued

Published TAC opinions are defined as ‘position statements’. Position statements are binding 
on the way that the audit and certification process is carried out and are considered to 
be an extension to the Standard. Sites must therefore be aware of any published position 
statements and, where necessary, ensure the information is transferred into action. Position 
statements are published on the ‘Food Safety Help and Guidance’ page of the BRCGS 
website and available on BRCGS Participate. They are communicated via the BRCGS 
newsletter. This newsletter is sent to all certificated companies. Position statements are also 
communicated to certification bodies via the bulletin.

1.1.10 Where the site is certificated to the Standard, it shall ensure that announced or blended 
announced recertification audits occur on or before the audit due date indicated on the 
certificate.

Interpretation Audit due dates

The audit due date is indicated on both the audit report and the certificate issued to all 
certificated sites. The responsibility for scheduling the next audit rests with the site.

Announced audits may be taken in the 28 calendar days up to and including the audit due 
date. Blended audits may commence within the 56 calendar days prior to the audit due date.

Late audits are likely to result in a gap in certification and a major non-conformity will be 
awarded unless exceptional circumstances occur as identified in the audit protocol section 
of the Standard (Part III, section 2.7.2). This includes situations where the site is:

• situated in a specific country, or an area within a specific country, where there is 
government advice not to visit and there is no suitable local auditor

• within a statutory exclusion zone that could compromise food safety or animal welfare
• in an area that has suffered a natural or unnatural disaster, rendering the site unable to 

produce or the auditor unable to visit
• affected by conditions that do not allow access to the site or restrict travel (e.g. heavy 

snow)
• producing seasonal products where production is delayed by a late start to the seasons 

(e.g. due to weather or product availability).

Lack of personnel is not an acceptable reason for adjusting the audit date. It is expected that 
the site will appoint adequate deputies and established systems of working to ensure the 
smooth operation of the site in the absence of individual managers. Nor is the undertaking 
of building work an acceptable reason for delay unless the site is not in production while the 
building work is carried out.

Where a site has an unannounced audit, either by opting into the voluntary unannounced 
scheme or due to the requirement for a mandatory unannounced audit, it becomes the 
responsibility of the certification body to ensure this requirement is met.

1.1.11 The most senior production or operations manager on site shall participate in the opening 
and closing meetings of the audit for certification to the Standard.

Relevant departmental managers or their deputies shall be available as required during the 
audit.

A member of the senior management team on site shall be available during the audit for a 
discussion on effective implementation of the food safety and quality culture plan.

Interpretation Senior management attendance at the audit

For a site to successfully complete a BRCGS audit, it will be necessary to involve a range of 
different site colleagues, including senior managers, section heads and staff responsible for 
completing specific activities. Involving a range of site colleagues in this way has a number 
of advantages, including:

• It allows the individuals that are responsible for, or who complete, specific activities to 
explain them and discuss any questions the auditor may have, ensuring that the auditor 
receives detailed, up-to-date information, and can observe the activity in action.

• It allows members of the team who are not currently needed for the audit to complete 
other duties, either as part of their normal work or preparation for other parts of the audit; 
for example, compiling the information for the vertical audit.

• It indicates a positive product safety culture, where management encourages staff of all 
levels to be involved in the audit process.

As a minimum the most senior production or operations managers on site (i.e. those who 
are responsible for the hands-on, daily running of the site) must participate in the opening 
and closing meetings of the audit. The objective is to ensure that non-conformities are 
effectively understood and agreed; therefore this site representative will need to be 
sufficiently senior to make decisions regarding any non-conformities and the corrective 
action to be taken.

The auditor will also need to discuss food safety and quality culture and the site’s 
implementation of its plan to improve the culture with this manager or an appropriate 
member of the senior management team.

It may be the case that the most senior operations managers within the company are 
absent on the day of the audit because of other commitments, especially where an audit is 
unannounced; however, there must always be a nominated deputy available (clause 1.2.1).

1.1.12 The site’s senior management shall ensure that the root causes of any non-conformities 
against the Standard identified at the previous audit have been effectively addressed to 
prevent recurrence.

Interpretation Recurring non-conformities

An important aspect of the Standard is to encourage continual improvement of product 
safety processes (e.g. see the statement of intent for section 1.1) and the prevention of non-
conforming situations is one aspect of this. Therefore, non-conformities identified in the 
previous certification audit must have been fully and effectively rectified (i.e. corrective and 
preventive actions completed) and these will be checked during the current audit. Therefore, 
for each non-conformity at the last audit, the auditor will expect to see:

• Corrective action  The site will have completed its corrective action within 28 days of the 
last audit. The auditor will therefore expect to see this action in operation (e.g. that the 
updated procedure submitted to the certification body as evidence of corrective action is 
in use, or that repairs have been completed and remain effective).



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

• Preventive action  At the time when the certificate was awarded, the site will have 
submitted a preventive action plan, but may not have completed all of the preventive 
action. The auditor will therefore expect to see evidence that the site implemented 
preventive action and that recurrence of the non-conformity has therefore been 
effectively prevented.

• Root cause analysis  Root cause analysis is used to identify the fundamental or root cause 
of a non-conformity, and is therefore a key activity in establishing appropriate preventive 
action. Although the site submitted the root cause analysis following the previous audit, 
the auditor may need to review this; for example, if preventive action has been ineffective 
at preventing the non-conformity.

This process is detailed in Part III of the Standard, section 2.3.2.

Many sites have found it useful to retain copies of records and documents implicated by 
non-conformities with the audit records. This allows quick and easy reference to the specific 
document while reviewing, investigating and correcting the non-conformity. (The original 
copy of the document, should, of course, be returned to the appropriate place in the site’s 
quality system.)

Note that additional information on preventive action and root cause analysis, and non-
conforming situations which require their use, is detailed in Part II, section 3.7 of the 
Standard, and especially clause 3.7.2.

A site’s attitude towards preventive action may also indicate its product safety culture. For 
example, minimal follow-up, or preventive action that is just seen as a necessary document 
to pass an audit, may be a sign of a poor culture.

BRCGS has published a guideline to understanding preventive action and root cause 
analysis which explains some of the techniques available for identifying the cause of 
non-conformities and preventing them from recurring. The guideline is available from the 
BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate.

If effective corrective or preventive action has not been introduced (e.g. it has been 
ineffective at preventing recurrence), a non-conformity may be raised against this clause, in 
addition to a non-conformity against the clause that has the recurring issue.

1.1.13 The BRCGS logo and references to certification status shall be used only in accordance 
with the conditions of use detailed in the audit protocol section (Part III, section 6.7) of the 
Standard.

Interpretation Use of the BRCGS logo

Sites that have gained certification against any of the BRCGS Standards are entitled to 
demonstrate their pride in their achievement and use the BRCGS certification logo for 
marketing purposes. This means the logo can be used on websites, letter headers, business 
cards, etc.

However, the logo is not a product certification mark, so it (or words stating that the product 
was produced in a BRCGS-certificated site) cannot be used on product packaging. The rules 
around logo use are highlighted in the protocol of the Standard (Part III, section 6.7) and 
further guidance is available in the Brand Guidelines on the BRCGS website.

Where an auditor finds consumer-facing packaging with any BRCGS logo or wording during 
an audit, they will raise a non-conformity.

1.1.14 Where required by legislation, the site shall maintain appropriate registrations with the 

relevant authorities.

Interpretation Registration of food production sites

In countries, states or territories where there is a legal requirement to register premises as 
food production sites, there must be documentary proof that the site has been appropriately 
registered.

The clause is not limited to food defence, but to all requirements for food manufacturing, 
food safety, authenticity, food defence, etc. However, the clause does not cover other legal 
registrations related to personnel, health and safety (such as fire regulations) or employment 
law, as these are outside the scope of the Standard. Examples of registration include:

• EU requirements detailed in EC Regulations No. 852/2004 on the Hygiene of Foodstuffs, 
Article 6(2) and No. 853/2004 for animal products processing

• FDA registration requirements in the US
• registration with the local authority in the UK.

1.2 Organisational structure, responsibilities and management authority

The company shall have a clear organisational structure and lines of communication to enable effective 
management of product safety, authenticity, legality and quality.

Interpretation

This section has three key objectives, to:

• facilitate clear communication of the roles and responsibilities for food safety, authenticity, legality and quality, 
and ensure that staff are aware who has these responsibilities

• ensure responsible individuals have the knowledge and ability to fulfil the role
• empower staff to communicate any concerns relating to product safety, authenticity, legality or quality to the 

relevant individuals, to facilitate a timely response where action is required.

Clause Requirements
1.2.1 The company shall have an organisation chart demonstrating the management structure of 

the company. The responsibilities for the management of activities which ensure food safety, 
authenticity, legality and quality shall be clearly allocated and understood by the managers 
responsible. It shall be clearly documented who deputises in the absence of the responsible 
person.

Interpretation Organisational charts and assignment of responsibilities

An organisational chart must be available, clearly indicating reporting lines for all managers 
on the site and, where applicable, relationships to the company head office roles. The chart 
would normally be expected to show both a position and the named person occupying that 
position. Where the chart shows job titles only, other documents must indicate the person 
occupying each position.

The chart or associated documentation needs to clearly indicate the responsibilities of each 
relevant member of staff with responsibility for the management of food safety, authenticity, 
legality or quality. Examples include technical managers, quality assurance staff, section 
heads/managers (e.g. those accountable for overseeing production and cleaning activities (i.e. 
those responsible for ensuring the correct standards are maintained)), any on-site laboratory 
staff and product development teams.

Responsibilities must be defined for key aspects of the food safety and quality management 
system, including, for example, decisions on corrective actions, non-conforming products, 
process deviations, finished product release, document control and customer complaints. 
It is usual for specific responsibilities to be defined within the job descriptions of key staff 
(especially for management and supervisors); however, they may instead be described within 
site procedures (e.g. responsibility for decisions on corrective action may be incorporated 
into the site’s corrective action procedure).

It must be clearly documented who is expected to deputise in the absence of a manager. 
Deputies would usually be identified on the organisational chart and/or in job descriptions, 
but documentation could also be in the form of an additional table. The responsibility 
may be assigned to either a more senior or more junior person, as long as the deputy has 
the knowledge and ability to adequately cover for the absent manager. Deputies may be 
appointed for the whole role or particular responsibilities may be deputised to different 
people; as long as this is clearly defined.

The auditor will be looking for both documented responsibilities and evidence that the 
responsible person is able to fulfil the role (clause 7.1.7 requires the company to review the 
competencies of staff and ensure that any necessary training, mentoring or experience is 
provided).

1.2.2 The site’s senior management shall ensure that all staff are aware of their responsibilities 
and demonstrate that work is carried out in accordance with documented site policies, 
procedures, work instructions and existing practices for activities undertaken. All staff shall 
have access to relevant documentation.

Interpretation Staff roles and responsibilities

The objective of this clause is to ensure that all staff, including temporary staff and 
employment agency staff, are able to work effectively and ensure that food safety, 
authenticity, legality and quality are maintained.

Consistent application of these systems relies on the correct and established processes 
being documented, accessible by relevant staff and used in practice. This will usually be 
established by the auditor discussing roles with the employees themselves during the audit. 
There is no requirement for a detailed job description; however, staff should be aware of 
their particular responsibilities. Where the role or an activity that makes up part of the role 
covers a food safety, authenticity, legality or quality issue described within a procedure (e.g. a 
CCP or prerequisite programme), the staff must understand what is expected and be able to 
access the relevant procedure.

1.2.3 Staff shall be aware of the need to report any risks or any evidence of unsafe or out-of-
specification product, equipment, packaging or raw materials, to a designated manager to 
enable the resolution of issues requiring immediate action.

Interpretation Reporting product safety risks and non-conforming product

Where a food safety risk is identified by a staff member, the reporting function and 
subsequent activity should be sufficiently rapid and effective to mitigate any food safety 
risks.

Identified risks may be associated with, for example, raw materials, work in progress, final 
product, packaging or equipment. Good practice is to encourage staff to report as wide a 
range of situations as possible, including out-of-specification results, damage, errors or when 
the staff member is concerned that something does not look right or as it normally does.

The transfer of information from staff to senior management regarding unsafe or out-of-
specification situations is an example of a good food safety culture. If staff feel supported 
and empowered to identify and report issues and make positive changes, this will typically 
be reflected in the effectiveness of the site’s product safety management systems.

1.2.4 If the site does not have the appropriate in-house knowledge of food safety, authenticity, 
legality or quality, external expertise (e.g. food safety consultants) may be used; however, the 
day-to-day management of the food safety systems shall remain the responsibility of the 
company.

Interpretation External expertise

Where external food safety consultants have been used as the main source of technical 
knowledge for a specific activity (e.g. to lead the development of the food safety plan or 
HACCP plan) it is essential that day-to-day responsibilities are under the control of the site 
and that it has personnel in place with working knowledge of the product safety systems, 
who can operate effectively even when the consultant is not available.

For example, the requirements of clause 1.2.1, regarding deputies and documented 
procedures, apply even where a food safety consultant is used.

A food safety consultant is seen as a service provider to the site and is therefore subject to 
the requirements of section 3.5.3.

2 The food safety plan – HACCP
Fundamental
The company shall have a fully implemented and effective food safety plan incorporating the Codex 
Alimentarius HACCP principles.

Interpretation

The purpose of these requirements is to create a food safety plan to mitigate food safety hazards. The foundation of 
this food safety plan is a hazard and risk analysis. In order to be effective this analysis must be systematic, science-
based, thorough, fully implemented and kept up to date.

In the food industry, the principles for assessing hazard and risk are commonly referred to as HACCP. However, the 
specific terminology used in the Standard, such as prerequisites and critical control points (CCPs), are drawn from 
global terminology used to describe expectations. Sites are not required to use the specific terminology used in 
the Standard; alternative terminology is acceptable, providing it is evident that all the requirements have been fully 
met. For example, legislative requirements in the US (detailed in the Food Safety Modernization Act) use different 
terminology but still incorporate all the requirements of the Standard.

Sites are advised to avoid having multiple plans with different terminology as this is administratively complex 
and unnecessary. (It may, of course, be appropriate to have multiple plans where a site produces different types of 
products with different product safety hazards, but common terminology should be used throughout.)

Regardless of the terminology used the food safety plan must incorporate all of the Codex Alimentarius HACCP 
principles. The clauses in Issue 9 have been updated to reflect the latest publication of the Codex Alimentarius 
HACCP principles, therefore where it is evident that all the requirements in section 2 have been fully met, a site will 
not be expected to undertake additional activities to meet the Codex Alimentarius principles.

The plan must be specific to the products manufactured, processed or packed on site and the production processes 
used.

Codex Alimentarius has published background information and extensive guidance on the HACCP principles which 
can be found in the General Principles of Food Hygiene (CXC1-1969) last updated in 2020. It can be downloaded 
from the Codex Alimentarius page on the FAO’s website.

BRCGS offers training on HACCP implementation. Details are available from the BRCGS website.

2.1 The HACCP food safety team (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 1)

Clause Requirements
2.1.1 The HACCP or food safety plan shall be developed and managed by a multi-disciplinary 

food safety team that includes those responsible for quality assurance, technical 
management, production operations and other relevant functions (e.g. engineering, hygiene).

The team leader shall have an in-depth knowledge of Codex HACCP principles (or 
equivalent) and be able to demonstrate competence, experience and training. Where there is 
a legal requirement for specific training, this shall be in place.

The team members shall have specific knowledge of HACCP and relevant knowledge of 
products, processes and associated hazards.

Interpretation The HACCP food safety team (aligned with Codex Alimentarius Step 1)

For a comprehensive HACCP or food safety plan to be established, maintained and kept up 
to date it needs to be managed by a nominated team with suitable training, relevant skills 
and experience.

The number of HACCP food safety team members needs to be appropriate to the size and 
structure of the company, as the team will include representatives of each department with 
responsibility for the operation of the Standard (e.g. technical, quality assurance, purchasing, 
engineering, new product development, hygiene/sanitation and senior leadership team). 
There will always be more than one person, since a single person does not constitute a 
‘team’. The team needs knowledge of the types of operations that are carried out at the site 
and the hazards these operations may present to the product.

It is good practice to document the team members within the study, with a summary of 
their roles, experience and areas of responsibility within the company. Membership of the 
HACCP food safety team needs to be reviewed and, when necessary, updated (e.g. when job 
responsibilities change or personnel leave or join the company).

The team leader must be able to demonstrate competency and experience in HACCP/food 
safety processes. This can be shown by:

• the quality of the plan
• documented evidence of their qualification (e.g. successful completion of an industry-

recognised HACCP training course)
• demonstrable, extensive experience in implementing or training HACCP.

The team will need sufficient knowledge of HACCP processes, products manufactured on 
site, production processes and relevant hazards, to facilitate a thorough hazard and risk 
analysis and the creation of an appropriate food safety plan. This may be demonstrated by, 
for example, training records (see clause 7.1.6) that show adequate training (e.g. through an 
industry-recognised training course or good quality internal training) has been given to all 
HACCP food safety team members. Any format or delivery method of training is permitted; 
however, the outcome should be a suitably trained individual capable of executing a HACCP 
or food safety plan as part of their team.

Where there is a legal requirement for specific training the site is expected to ensure this 
has been completed.

Where external expertise has been used in developing the HACCP or food safety plan, the 
site must demonstrate ownership of the identified requirements by ensuring that the day-
to-day management of the food safety system remains the responsibility of the site (see 
clause 1.2.4).

At the audit, the competency and understanding of the HACCP/food safety plan team will 
be assessed, as well as the quality of the resultant HACCP or food safety plan. The site 
should also be able to establish the training and competence of any external consultant in 
HACCP/food safety principles (see section 3.5.3).

Senior management commitment (clauses 1.1.1 to 1.1.14) is required to support the HACCP 
food safety team. This may be demonstrated by the presence of senior management 
within the team, policy statements referring to HACCP or food safety, or evidence within 
management review meetings that HACCP/food safety issues are discussed and reviewed.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

The existence of a food safety plan does not, in itself, guarantee product safety, and it is vital 
that the results of the HACCP or food safety plan are implemented, applied correctly and 
integrated into the food safety and quality management system.

2.1.2 The scope of each HACCP or food safety plan, including the products and processes 
covered, shall be defined.

Interpretation Scope of the HACCP or food safety plan

The scope of the HACCP or food safety plan must be identified. The scope should describe 
all the products and processes to be included within the study. In sites with a small range 
of similar products, it may be possible to incorporate all of the products and processes 
into a single HACCP or food safety plan; however, where there is a wide range of different 
products or processes with different hazards, it is likely that the site will need to use more 
than one plan.

The format of these plans is not prescribed by the Standard; various formats are acceptable 
as long as the scope for each plan is clearly defined and all activities and products are 
covered within the processes. For example, a HACCP or food safety plan may cover each 
group of products with similar process characteristics, or the plan may be split into ‘modules’ 
which cover specific process steps; these modules can then be used in a ‘mix and match’ 
structure to create a HACCP or food safety plan for any given product.

2.2 Prerequisite programmes

Clause Requirements
2.2.1 The site shall establish and maintain environmental and operational programmes necessary 

to create an environment suitable to produce safe and legal food products (prerequisite 
programmes). As a guide these may include the following, although this is not an exhaustive 
list:

• cleaning and disinfection (see section 4.11)
• pest management (see section 4.14)
• maintenance programmes for equipment and buildings (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)
• personal hygiene requirements (see section 7.2)
• staff training (see section 7.1)
• supplier approval and purchasing (see section 3.5.1)
• transportation arrangements (see section 4.16)
• processes to prevent cross-contamination (see sections 4.9 and 4.10)
• allergen management (see section 5.3).

The prerequisite programmes for the particular areas of the site shall take into account the 
production risk zoning (see clause 4.3.1).

The control measures and monitoring procedures for the prerequisite programmes shall 
be clearly documented and shall be included within the development and reviews of the 
HACCP or food safety plan.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Prerequisites

The prerequisites are the basic environmental and production conditions necessary for the 
manufacture of safe food and the control of generic hazards. Note that the list of examples 
in the Standard is not exhaustive, and others will exist in some sites; for example, utilities, 
air and general aspects of the production environment. Sites must therefore define the full 
range of prerequisites applicable to their site and operations.

Although the prerequisites are usually covered by day-to-day activities such as good 
manufacturing or hygiene practices, it is vital that they work effectively and to the correct 
standards as:

• The prerequisite programme needs to provide a solid base on which the rest of the 
HACCP or food safety plan can be developed.

• The company is relying on the prerequisite activities to mitigate the identified hazards and 
deliver safe product (e.g. if a site identifies cleaning as a prerequisite, then it relies on the 
cleaning activities to adequately remove food residues and dirt that might otherwise result 
in hazards such as allergen cross-contamination or microbiological contamination).

Therefore there should be a whole work stream behind each identified prerequisite to 
ensure that the relevant activity, procedures and policies are in place, that they are working 
correctly and that they continue to deliver the level of control required.

Although the prerequisite programme is expected to be effective in achieving the level of 
control required to ensure food safety, it is not a requirement that a documented validation 
of every prerequisite is undertaken, as prerequisite programmes typically cover a wide range 
of general environmental controls, often with results that are not quantifiable. However, 
where a prerequisite programme is used to manage a specific hazard (e.g. cleaning regimes 
used to prevent allergen cross-contamination), there needs to be a documented validation 
that the prerequisite controls the identified hazard (see clause 2.7.4 for further details 
regarding the validation). Some companies prefer to differentiate prerequisites that manage 
specific hazards from other prerequisites by referring to them as operational prerequisites 
(oPRPs).

Sites that need to meet the requirements of the US Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) 
should note that they must ensure that preventive controls are subject to validation and 
verification. Some of these controls may cover activities that have traditionally formed part 
of the prerequisite programme.

The clause contains references to later sections of the Standard which provide detail 
on the requirements for effective management of some specific prerequisites, including 
cleaning (section 4.11), pest management (section 4.14) and training (section 7.1). These are 
not intended to be an exhaustive list of all prerequisites or all the relevant sections of the 
Standard.

The prerequisite programmes are often dependent on the production risk zoning (see clause 
4.3.1); for example, cleaning within a high-risk zone. Therefore it may be necessary to place 
greater attention on some prerequisites that are particularly important for food safety in 
those specific zones.

Good practice is to review the prerequisite programmes and their management. The 
frequency of this review should be based on risk, but it could be included, for example, in 
the annual review of the HACCP or food safety plan.

2.3 Describe the product (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 2)

Clause Requirements
2.3.1 A full description for each product or group of products shall be developed, which includes 

all relevant information on food safety. As a guide, this may include the following, although 
this is not an exhaustive list:

• composition (e.g. raw materials, ingredients, allergens, recipe)
• origin of ingredients
• physical or chemical properties that impact food safety (e.g. pH, aw)
• treatment and processing (e.g. cooking, cooling)
• packaging system (e.g. modified atmosphere, vacuum)
• storage and distribution conditions (e.g. chilled, ambient)
• maximum safe shelf life under prescribed storage and usage conditions.

Interpretation Product description

A full description of the product is required to ensure that all aspects that could potentially 
affect food safety are considered. The Standard gives guidance on the factors that may be 
considered:

• composition (e.g. raw materials or ingredients used, allergens, recipes)
• origin of the ingredients (e.g. climatic conditions, culture or food safety standards may 

make some countries a greater risk than others)
• physical or chemical properties that impact food safety (e.g. pH, aw)
• treatment and processing conditions (e.g. cooking, chilling)
• product packaging system (e.g. modified atmosphere, vacuum packing or canning)
• storage and distribution conditions (e.g. chilled, frozen or ambient)
• maximum safe shelf life under prescribed storage and usage conditions.

Good practice is not to simply describe the product, but to consider the possible 
implications of what will be needed later in the HACCP study. For example, when 
considering the origin of ingredients, rather than just stating the material comes from a 
specific country or region, it may be useful to consider whether the potential climatic 
conditions, culture or food safety standards in the country change the hazards.

Product groups can be used where the products are similar (e.g. different pack sizes). 
However, where significantly different products (e.g. coated and non-coated meat products) 
are manufactured, these are to be treated as separate products or groups.

available on request. As a guide, this may include the following, although this is not an 
exhaustive list:

• the latest scientific literature
• historical and known hazards associated with specific food products
• relevant codes of practice
• recognised guidelines
• food safety legislation relevant for the production and sale of products
• customer requirements
• a copy of any existing site HACCP plans (e.g. for products already in production at the site)

• indication of any areas (zones) where high-risk, high-care or ambient high-care production 

facilities are required (see clause 4.3.1).

Interpretation Sources of information

Up-to-date background information must be taken into account when preparing the HACCP 
or food safety plan. Therefore, suitable information must be collated and maintained.

There are many sources of information, particularly on the internet; for example, Codex 
Alimentarius, European Food Safety Authority, US Food and Drug Administration, or 
the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). Sources of information must be 
referenced in the HACCP or food safety plan and be recoverable or available on request 
(using an internet search engine to find the information during an audit is not acceptable, 
as this implies that the information was not collected and maintained for use during the 
development of the HACCP or food safety plan). A list of legislation and codes of practice 
referenced may be helpful.

Many membership organisations also provide useful information. Where membership 
information is referenced, this also needs to be available on site (either electronically or as 
hard copy).

The Standard gives some guidance on the types of information that may be considered in 
developing the HACCP or food safety plan. These include:

• the latest scientific literature (good practice is to understand the source of the material; 
for example, peer-reviewed science may have greater validity and usefulness)

• historical and known hazards associated with specific food products (good practice is to 
be as specific as possible, giving, for example, the name of the micro-organism(s) that are 
known hazards to the product, rather than just listing ‘bacteria’)

• relevant codes of practice
• recognised guidelines – for example:

• material provided on BRCGS Participate
• publication by regulatory authorities
• publications available from industry experts, trade associations, etc.

• food safety legislation relevant for the production and sale of products in destination 
countries, states or territories

result in additional risks that need to be managed
• a map of the premises and equipment layout

2.4 Identify intended use (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 3)

Clause Requirements
2.4.1 The intended use of the product by the customer, and expected alternative uses, shall be 

described, defining the consumer target groups, including the suitability of the product for 
vulnerable groups of the population (e.g. infants, elderly, allergy sufferers).

Interpretation Identify the use

The HACCP food safety team needs to consider and document the intended use of the 
products by the customer and the ultimate consumer to ensure all the risks have been 
assessed. For example, the team should consider:

• the target population (e.g. does this include high-risk groups such as infants, elderly 
people or allergy sufferers?)

• handling and preparation (e.g. will the product be consumed without further cooking?)
• the customer supply chain
• storage (e.g. frozen, or the requirement for chilled storage after opening the pack).

Where there is an expected alternative food use for a product, including the potential 
for a customer or consumer to misuse or mistreat the product in a way not intended by 
the manufacturer, this information should be included in the description in the HACCP 
assessment so that any implications can be considered as part of the subsequent hazard 
analysis. This alternative use may occur in the consumer’s home (e.g. consumption of a 
product that looks ready to eat without completing the correct cooking) or elsewhere in the 
supply chain (e.g. an unintended use of a raw material). A number of product recalls have 
occurred, for example, with frozen raw vegetables and coated/battered poultry products due 
to unintended use of the product. Inclusion of intended and expected alternative uses of a 
product can also provide a useful due diligence reference demonstrating to a customer or 
regulatory authority the scope of hazards that have been considered.

2.5 Construct a process flow diagram (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 4)

Clause Requirements
2.5.1 A flow diagram shall be prepared to cover each product, product category or process. This 

shall set out all aspects of the food process operation within the HACCP or food safety plan 
scope, from raw material receipt through to processing, storage and distribution. As a guide, 
this should include the following, although this is not an exhaustive list:

• plan of premises and equipment layout
• raw materials, including introduction of utilities and other contact materials (e.g. water, 

packaging)
• sequence and interaction of all process steps
• outsourced processes and subcontracted work
• potential for process delay
• rework and recycling
• low-risk/high-risk/high-care area segregation
• finished products, intermediate/semi-processed products, by-products and waste.

Interpretation Process flow diagram

The process flow diagram provides the site with an important tool, allowing it to evaluate the 
possible introduction, occurrence or change of hazards at each step of the process. It should 
therefore be used when identifying hazards (see clause 2.7.1) and conducting hazard analysis 
(see clause 2.7.2).

Therefore, an accurate flow diagram indicating all the process steps, including all inputs and 
outputs, needs to be constructed for each HACCP or food safety plan. This may be achieved 
with a single diagram, or it could be in a modular form with several documents compiled to 
provide the complete information (in this situation it must clearly identify the interaction 
between the process steps). The Standard lists guidance on the points to consider and 
include when developing the flow diagram; for example:

• a plan of the premises and equipment layout to facilitate consideration of cross-
contamination risks (e.g. allergen control)

• raw materials – it should be clear where raw materials are stored and the routes they take 
into the production area; this includes the introduction of utilities and other contact 
materials (e.g. water or packaging)

• sequence and interaction of all process steps (e.g. method of transportation between each 
step)

• outsourced processes and subcontracted work, including, for example, off-site processing, 
storage, packing or transport

• potential for process delay (i.e. how products or ingredients will be handled if a delay 
occurs)

• rework and recycling
• low-risk/high-risk/high-care segregation (i.e. clearly indicating where the different 

production zones are located)
• finished products, intermediate/semi-processed products, by-products and waste (e.g. 

where waste products leave the production process, and the storage of intermediates and 
finished products).

Clause 3.2.1 of the Standard requires the site to have an effective document control system. 
Signing and dating the approved process flow diagram is one method of demonstrating that 
this is occurring.

products or processes, a modular option may be preferable; Figures 2 and 3 show examples. 
Otherwise a separate linear diagram is needed for each product; i.e. 20 products would need

If you use a modular or generic diagram, take care to ensure that it includes all steps and 
all products. If your site manufactures multiple products that are considerably different or 
require different processes, you will need to have several separate diagrams.

In addition to the process steps, the diagram needs to contain:

• all raw materials used in the manufacture of the product(s), including the introduction of 
utilities and other contact materials (e.g. water or packaging)

• details of any outsourced or subcontracted process (i.e. any activity that is part of the 
production process but does not occur on site)

• rework or recycling
• low-risk, high-care and high-risk segregation
• routes taken by waste products
• all finished products, intermediates, semi-processed products or by-products.

2.6 Verify process flow diagram (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 5)

Clause Requirements
2.6.1 The HACCP food safety team shall verify the accuracy of the flow diagrams by on-site audit 

at least annually, and whenever there are changes to the process, to ensure any changes have 
been considered as a part of the HACCP or food safety plan. Daily and seasonal variations 
shall be considered and evaluated. Records of verified flow diagrams shall be maintained.

Interpretation Verifying the flow diagram

The flow diagram shall be verified as accurate. A member of the HACCP food safety team 
who is based at the site, part of the team, or the whole team must check that the flow 
diagram is accurate by on-site audit. This may be achieved using a physical walk-through of 
the process within the production area. A report of the activity and any findings will help to 
demonstrate that this has been completed.

During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will confirm the accuracy of the documented process 
flow diagram by following the process in production.

It is vital that the process flow diagram remains up to date; therefore verification should 
occur whenever there is a review of the HACCP or food safety plan (e.g. whenever there 
is a change to the plan or operational activity) and at least once per year. For example, the 
manufacture of a new product (see clause 5.1.2) should result in a HACCP review to confirm 
that any hazards to existing products have been managed appropriately, as well as ensuring 
that any hazards affecting the new product are controlled.

It is important that any daily (e.g. different shifts, including any night or weekend shifts) or 
seasonal variations are considered during the verification process (e.g. the production of a 
Christmas range that uses ingredients or processes not used during the rest of the year or 
significant changes in production volume).

The site must retain records of the diagrams and verification activities. For example, a 
verification record could include an annotated diagram showing:

• the date and time of the verification
• the product(s) being manufactured at the time the activity was observed
• any amendments or alterations that were noted.

Alternatively, a separate report could be produced in the format of an internal audit.

The records should also be signed to confirm who completed the verification.

2.7 List all potential hazards associated with each process step, conduct a hazard 
analysis and consider any measures to control identified hazards (equivalent to 
Codex Alimentarius Step 6, Principle 1)

Clause Requirements
2.7.1 The HACCP food safety team shall identify and record all the potential hazards that are 

reasonably expected to occur at each step in relation to product, process and facilities. 
This shall include hazards present in raw materials, those introduced during the process or 
surviving the process steps, and consideration of the following types of hazard:

• microbiological
• physical contamination
• chemical and radiological contamination
• fraud (e.g. substitution or deliberate/intentional adulteration) (see section 5.4)
• malicious contamination of products (see section 4.2)
• allergen risks (see section 5.3).

It shall also take account of the preceding and following steps in the process chain.

Interpretation List of potential hazards

It is expected that the list will include specific hazards. The Standard provides examples of 
those that should be considered, including:

• specific micro-organisms (e.g. E. coli or Salmonella)
• specific chemicals (e.g. veterinary residues, pesticides or radiological contaminants)
• cleaning chemicals
• machinery lubricants
• specific foreign bodies (e.g. glass, metal or plastic)
• specific allergens (e.g. peanuts or egg); i.e. those identified by the company, materials that 

are considered allergens in the country of intended sale and any customer requirements
• the potential for fraud and/or adulteration
• malicious tampering with the product or processes.

It is important that the company considers all relevant potential hazards from all relevant 
sources. These could include raw materials, processes and the factory environment. The 
process flow diagram is a useful tool in considering the potential risks at each stage of 
production. Some sites find it useful to consider each hazard, at each step, in terms of:

• whether the hazard is likely to be present in, for example, the raw material or the 
processing environment

• whether there is the potential to introduce or create a specific hazard at the step in the 
process being considered

• if there is the potential for growth of micro-organisms
• whether the hazard will survive the processing step; for example, whether a pathogen 

can survive in the product, or whether the contaminant is stable to the process being 
completed (e.g. heat stable).

There must be a description of each hazard and its sources – one hazard may have several 
potential sources and occur at more than one point in the process. This is important to 
ensure that effective controls for each source of hazard are established in the subsequent 
steps of the process.

The Standard has referenced food fraud and malicious contamination (food defence) in 
the list of hazards in this clause to draw attention to the need to include these within 
site assessments. However, later sections of the Standard (sections 4.2 and 5.4) provide 
greater detail on the expected activity in these areas. This clause does not require 
those assessments to be repeated or duplicated (as part of the HACCP plan, and then in 
compliance with sections 4.2 and 5.4) – separate assessment processes are acceptable and 
the site can reference the additional assessment within the HACCP plan. However, the 
outputs from those separate assessments must be considered as part of this process, to 
ensure that the correct controls, monitoring, verification, etc. are in place.

The aim of including radiological hazards within the clause is to consider potential 
contamination by radioactive isotopes (a legal requirement in some countries) which 
may be present in water or soil (either from a naturally occurring source or resulting from 
contamination caused by humans). A number of authorities produce reports on known 
radiological hazards; for example:

2.7.2 The HACCP food safety team shall conduct a hazard analysis to identify the significant 
hazards (i.e. those hazards that are reasonably likely to occur at an unacceptable level), which 
need to be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels. Consideration shall be 
given to the following:

• likely occurrence of hazard
• severity of the effects on consumer safety
• vulnerability of those exposed
• survival and multiplication of micro-organisms of specific concern to the product
• presence or production of toxins, chemicals or foreign bodies
• contamination of raw materials, intermediate/semi-processed product, or finished product.

Where elimination of the hazard is not practical, justification for acceptable levels of the 
hazard in the finished product shall be determined and documented.

Interpretation Hazard analysis

Any hazards identified in clause 2.7.1 must be evaluated against the criteria detailed in this 
clause to identify those which are significant. For the purposes of the Standard a significant 
hazard is a hazard identified by the hazard analysis, which is reasonably likely to occur in the 
absence of a control, at an unacceptable level (i.e. a level that would be considered unsafe or 
illegal), and therefore control is essential for the production of a safe product. The HACCP 
food safety team must therefore take into account:

• the likely occurrence of the hazard, taking into consideration existing prerequisite 
programmes, the nature of the facility and the equipment used

• the severity of the effects on consumer safety
• the vulnerability of those exposed
• the survival and growth of micro-organisms (i.e. those of concern to the product(s) within 

the scope of the HACCP or food safety plan)
• the presence or production of toxins, chemicals or foreign bodies
• contamination of raw materials, intermediates, semi-processed product or finished 

product.

Evidence of the decisions, along with the justification for the decision and the decision-
making process, must be kept within the HACCP or food safety plan.

There are a range of tools that may assist with the evaluation of hazards (e.g. quadrant 
graphs, scoring systems, logic tables or decision trees). The team may choose to use these 
tools but should keep a record of any that are deployed. Such tools may also help in 
establishing CCPs.

It is useful to remember that the quality of the output from the assessment depends on 
the quality of the data or evidence used. The hazard analysis should, wherever possible, be 
based on demonstrable evidence such as documented validation studies, trend analysis 
and science-based literature. Where this information is not available at the site, it may be 
necessary for the site to obtain it from suppliers or reputable external sources to establish 
the likelihood or severity of the specific hazards.

Where elimination of a hazard is not possible, acceptable levels need to be defined. 
Reference should be made to legal requirements or scientific evidence to justify the 
acceptable levels (e.g. microbiological standards or presence of mycotoxins).

2.7.3 The HACCP food safety team shall consider the control measures necessary to prevent or 
eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level.

Consideration may be given to using more than one control measure.

Interpretation Control measures

Control measures required to reduce or eliminate the specific hazards (i.e. each hazard 
identified in clause 2.7.1) must be established. Any hazard that cannot be eliminated must 
have control measures designed to reduce it to an acceptable level of presence. This 
acceptable level (e.g. setting a target of <100 cfu/g of Staphylococcus aureus in finished 
product) needs to be justified; in other words the site should understand the potential 
consequences of the hazard and be able to demonstrate that the acceptable level will 
adequately protect the consumer.

Industry guidelines, codes of practice, legislation etc. can help to establish and justify these 
levels.

2.7.4 Where the control of a specific food safety hazard is achieved through prerequisite 
programmes (see section 2.2) or control measures other than critical control points (CCPs; 
see clause 2.8.1), this shall be stated and the adequacy of the programme to control the 
specific hazard validated.

Interpretation Validation of prerequisites

It is important that all controls are effective and consistently prevent identified hazards from 
occurring. Therefore where specific hazards are controlled by mechanisms other than CCPs 
(e.g. by prerequisite programmes or other control measures) these also need to be validated.

It is not a requirement that a documented validation of every prerequisite is undertaken, as 
prerequisite programmes typically cover a wide range of general environmental controls, 
often with results that are not quantifiable. However, where a prerequisite programme is 
used to manage a specific hazard (e.g. cleaning regimes used to prevent allergen cross-
contamination), there needs to be a documented validation that the prerequisite controls

Interpretation

the identified hazard. Some companies prefer to differentiate these prerequisites that 
manage specific hazards from other prerequisites, by referring to them as operational 
prerequisites (oPRPs).

Examples of prerequisites that require validation include:

• control of allergen cross-contamination by cleaning the production equipment. Evidence 
is required that the cleaning regime can effectively and consistently remove the allergen 
(examples of how this might be achieved are given in the guidance to clause 5.3.8).

• chilled storage conditions for product safety. The defined storage temperature must be 
validated by reference to technical literature, confirming the control of growth of relevant 
spoilage or food poisoning organisms. The storage facility must be validated as being 
capable of consistently delivering the defined temperature.

Prerequisites used to control specific hazards must also be subject to routine verification 
and monitoring, and records should detail the control measures and monitoring procedures 
used (see clause 2.12.2 for full details of this requirement).

2.8 Determine the CCPs (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 7, Principle 2)

Clause Requirements
2.8.1 For each hazard that requires control, control points shall be reviewed to identify those that 

are critical. This requires a logical approach and may be facilitated by use of a decision tree. 
CCPs shall be those control points which are required in order to prevent or eliminate a 
food safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level. If a hazard is identified at a step where 
control is necessary for safety but the control does not exist, the product or process shall be 
modified at that step, or at an earlier step, to provide a control measure.

Interpretation Determine the critical control points – Codex Alimentarius Step 7, Principle 2

Each control measure must be examined to identify which are critical (i.e. to identify the 
points at which control can be applied). This is essential to prevent or eliminate a food 
safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level.

Records must be available showing how this has been conducted and how decisions have 
been reached.

The Standard is not prescriptive on the tools used to facilitate this process; for example, 
a two- or four-question decision tree may be useful. The site must, however, be able to 
demonstrate that it has used a logical approach and, therefore, a copy of any decision-
making tools used and the results (e.g. the results of the questions from the decision tree) 
must be recorded.

If a hazard has been identified as critical but there is no control measure at that step or any 
other, the product or process should be modified so that a suitable control measure can be 
incorporated either at this step or at an earlier point in the process.

Sites working in accordance with the US Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) are likely to 
find that the preventive controls required by that legislation include all of the controls that 
would normally be identified as CCPs using a HACCP system. For example, CCPs are known

as process preventive controls (PPCs) in an FSMA-compliant food safety plan. For 
certification purposes, it does not matter which terms are referenced as their management 
(for certification purposes) would be the same. Other preventive controls are historically 
treated as PRPs (prerequisite programmes) in many sites. In some cases, parts of them are 
elevated to preventive controls; these include food allergen, sanitation, supply chain, based 
on known or reasonably foreseeable risk of a serious adverse health consequence or death 
to humans or animals (SAHCODHA) hazard.

Where the management components of those preventive controls do not contain all the 
same elements of the CCPs/PPCs it is expected that the site would combine the most 
stringent requirements of FSMA and the Standard together. For example, a sanitation 
preventive control does not require validation for allergen cleaning under FSMA but it 
is required by the Standard (see clause 2.7.4), therefore the Standard expects additional 
compliance with this requirement.

Auditors shall be looking to confirm that the site has identified the correct points at which 
control should be exercised by the appropriate control mechanisms.

2.9 Establish validated critical limits for each CCP (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius 
Step 8, Principle 3)

Interpretation

Once the HACCP or food safety team has identified all the relevant CCPs, it must then identify critical limits. The 
critical limit is the point that separates safe from unsafe or acceptable from unacceptable product.

Some critical limits are defined by legislation; however, many will require experimental results, the advice of 
appropriate industry specialists or consideration of customer requirements.

Clause Requirements
2.9.1 For each CCP, the appropriate critical limits shall be defined in order to identify clearly 

whether the process is in or out of control. Critical limits shall be:

• measurable wherever possible (e.g. time, temperature, pH)
• supported by clear guidance or examples where measures are subjective (e.g. photographs).

Interpretation Critical limits

All identified CCPs must have defined critical limits – the point that, if properly and 
consistently implemented, separates safe from unsafe or acceptable from unacceptable 
product.

Wherever possible the criteria used should be objective (i.e. measurable), such as the 
temperature, time, moisture level, pH and aw.

Where objective criteria are not available, subjective parameters can be used. These 
may include sensory parameters such as visual appearance and texture, but they must be 
supported by clear guidance or examples. Photographs of acceptable and unacceptable 
limits or product samples for comparison could be shown as examples to staff at process 
control points.

Interpretation 
continued

Good practice is often to identify action limits as well as critical limits with the aim of 
ensuring the measured parameter remains controlled; i.e. to identify a point at which action 
can be taken or a review completed, when the product or process is approaching the critical 
limit, but prior to it actually exceeding the critical limit.

Details on how the critical limits have been determined must be documented; these may 
include industry best practice, legislation or validation studies undertaken by the company.

2.9.2 The HACCP food safety team shall validate each CCP, including critical limits. Documented 
evidence shall show that the control measures selected and critical limits identified are 
capable of consistently controlling the hazard to the specified acceptable level.

Interpretation Validation and documentation of critical limits

Documented evidence must be available showing how the control measures for CCPs and 
critical limits have been validated to ensure they control, reduce or eliminate the hazard to 
an acceptable level.

Validation must be specific and demonstrate that if the control measures are followed as 
specified and the critical limits are met (at minimum and maximum levels where a range 
is indicated), a consistently safe product will be produced. Evidence could come from 
professional bodies, trade associations, historical processing data, scientific and technical 
literature or legislation. In addition, scientifically valid experimental or pilot plant trial data 
or exercises, such as challenge testing, may be required to confirm the capability of the 
process.

2.10 Establish a monitoring system for each CCP (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius 
Step 9, Principle 4)

Interpretation

Monitoring is a planned set of checks or measurements for each CCP to ensure it is consistently meeting the 
identified critical limit. Monitoring must be recorded in terms of both the procedures to be followed and the results 
obtained.

Clause Requirements
2.10.1 A monitoring procedure shall be established for each CCP to ensure compliance with 

critical limits. The monitoring system shall be able to detect loss of control of CCPs and, 
wherever possible, provide information in time for corrective action to be taken. As a guide, 
consideration may be given to the following, although this is not an exhaustive list:

• online measurement
• offline measurement
• continuous measurement (e.g. thermographs, pH meters).

Where discontinuous measurement is used, the system shall ensure that the sample taken is 
representative of the batch of product.

Interpretation Monitoring systems

Each CCP needs to be monitored to ensure the established limits are not exceeded. This 
can be achieved by observing or measuring the CCP at scheduled intervals or by the use of 
automated continuous measurement systems.

A monitoring procedure must be established for each CCP. At a minimum, this should 
include:

• the CCP to which the procedure relates
• the staff (or staff role) responsible for monitoring the CCP (clause 1.2.1 requires the staff 

responsible for product safety activities to be documented)
• training requirements for responsible staff (see clause 7.1.2)
• the frequency at which the monitoring is completed
• instructions on how the monitoring is completed
• the requirements for record-keeping (clause 2.10.2)
• the critical limit(s).

It is often useful for the procedure to include the action to be taken if the specified limit is 
exceeded (e.g. who to inform).

Monitoring must be able to detect variation, which may result in limits being broken if no 
remedial action is taken. Wherever possible, monitoring must be sufficiently frequent to 
ensure that any necessary remedial action can be taken in adequate time so that there is no 
risk to the product and that no potentially affected product is released for sale or dispatched 
to the customer.

Methods used may include online or offline measurements and may be continuous or 
discontinuous.

2.10.2 Records associated with the monitoring of each CCP shall include the date, time and result 
of measurement, and shall be signed by the person responsible for the monitoring and 
verified, when appropriate, by a suitably competent and authorised person. Where records 
are in electronic form, there shall be evidence that records have been checked and verified.

Interpretation Monitoring system records

The results of monitoring activities must be recorded. At a minimum, these records must 
include:

• date and time when the measurement was made
• the result
• the signature of the individual conducting the monitoring
• the signature of the individual (e.g. the line manager) checking and verifying the record.

Records of the monitoring should be evaluated by a designated person with knowledge to 
confirm the acceptability (or otherwise) of the results and authority to carry out corrective 
actions when necessary. It is often valuable for the verification to be completed by a 
different individual rather than the staff member who completed the monitoring, however, 
this is not always possible in very small sites. This verification should be completed at 
appropriate frequencies which, depending on working practices, may be at identified points 
during the day (e.g. at the end of the shift) rather than every time a measurement is made.

2.11 Establish a corrective action plan (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 10, 
Principle 5)

Clause Requirements
2.11.1 The HACCP food safety team shall specify and document the corrective action to be 

taken when monitored results indicate a failure to meet a control limit, or when monitored 
results indicate a trend towards loss of control. This shall include the action to be taken by 
nominated personnel with regard to any products that have been manufactured during the 
period when the process was out of control.

Interpretation Establish a corrective action plan

A documented procedure needs to be established, detailing the actions to be taken when 
monitoring indicates that limits have been exceeded or when trends suggest they may be 
exceeded if no remedial action is taken.

The site will need to ensure that all CCPs are covered by corrective action plans. This may be 
achieved by having a single corrective action document or by individual documents for each 
CCP. However, it is important that the identified actions are specific to each CCP and not 
simply generic statements.

The procedure must include:

• Authorised personnel – identify who can make decisions about product produced where 
limits have been exceeded and the corrective actions to be taken.

• Immediate remedial action to be taken – for example, to bring the process back within 
critical limits.

• Quarantine procedures – instructions on how implicated products (those that have passed 
through the process and may therefore have exceeded the limits) are identified, handled, 
isolated and/or stored until their safety status is established (e.g. products that have been 
metal-detected since the last satisfactory metal detector check). The handling and storage 
procedure must ensure that implicated product cannot enter production or be distributed 
to customers unless it has been confirmed as safe and released by the authorised staff.

• Disposal procedures for unsafe products.
• Additional actions that may be required (e.g. alternative processing, increased monitoring, 

etc.).

Good practice is to use root cause analysis, where possible, to identify and correct the 
fundamental cause of the out-of-specification result.

All actions should be recorded.

When investigation shows that the implicated product is safe and can be released to 
customers it may be necessary to review the critical limit, as the ‘safe’ product implies that 
the critical limit has not been set at the correct value.

2.12 Validate the HACCP plan and establish verification procedures (equivalent to 
Codex Alimentarius Step 11, Principle 6)

Interpretation

Validation is defined as obtaining evidence through the provision of objective evidence that a control or measure, 
if properly implemented, is capable of delivering the specified outcome. In other words, it is objectively confirming 
that the plan will perform, effectively, as intended.

Similarly, verification is the application of methods, procedures, tests and other evaluations, in addition to 
monitoring, to determine whether a control or measure is or has been operating as intended. In other words, 
verification seeks to answer the question, ‘Has it been operating effectively, as intended?’ Codex Alimentarius has 
published guidelines for the validation of food safety control measures (CXG 69-2008) which can be downloaded 
from the Codex Alimentarius guidelines page of the FAO’s website.

Clause Requirements
2.12.1 HACCP or food safety plans shall be validated prior to any changes which may affect 

product safety, to ensure that the plan will effectively control the identified hazards before 
implementation.

For existing HACCP or food safety plans, this may be achieved using the established 
processes detailed in clauses 2.12.2 and 2.12.3.

Interpretation Validation of the HACCP or food safety plan

It is important that the site validates the food safety plan to confirm it will perform, 
effectively, as intended, and therefore prevent food safety hazards from occurring. In other 
words, the site should assess whether what it intends to put in place will actually work in 
practice.

Obviously, to be effective this validation needs to be completed before the plan is 
implemented and before any changes are made (e.g. in production) that could affect food 
safety.

In some countries (e.g. the US), there is an additional legal requirement for a revalidation 
after implementation, which must occur within a specified timescale, such as 90 days. This 
is good practice as it allows sites to consider the effects of upscaling (i.e. moving from trial 
systems to full production) or any other changes that may have occurred during the first few 
weeks of production, and therefore ensure that the plan still accurately reflects the actual 
production. Sites operating in countries where this is not a legal requirement may also find 
this a useful good-practice addition to their ways of working.

There are a number of aspects of the plan that should be validated, including:

• production process flow
• identification of the correct hazards at the correct steps of the process
• identification of the correct CCPs
• the establishment of monitoring and verification activities, including what to monitor and 

how frequently
• critical limits and the corrective actions associated with each CCP.

Validation in this context could include a range of activities, depending on the relevant 
hazards, such as:

• review of literature
• mathematical modelling
• validation studies
• guidance from authoritative sources (e.g. legislation).

It is important that the site has a mechanism to ensure that every subsequent change is 
captured and reviewed. This might include changes to processes or seasonality.

Where a HACCP plan already exists and has been operating effectively for a period of 
time the validation may be achieved using established verification and review processes 
developed in accordance with clauses 2.12.2 and 2.12.3.

Clause Requirements
2.12.2 Procedures of verification shall be established to confirm that the HACCP or food safety 

plan, including controls managed by prerequisite programmes, continues to be effective. 
Examples of verification activities include:

• internal audits
• review of records where acceptable limits have been exceeded
• review of complaints by enforcement authorities or customers
• review of incidents of product withdrawal or recall.

Results of verification shall be recorded and communicated to the HACCP food safety team.

Interpretation Establish verification procedures

The HACCP or food safety plan, including controls managed by prerequisites, must be 
verified to ensure that it remains effective.

Verification requires objective evidence that the specified requirements are being met. 
This may include verification that monitoring has been completed correctly, that results 
are understood and that appropriate corrective actions have been completed. Examples of 
activity that can be included in verification studies are:

• internal audits (e.g. to ensure the correct procedures and work instructions are in use and 
that monitoring frequencies are correct)

• review and trending of records (e.g. CCP monitoring records)
• review of complaints by enforcement authorities or customers
• review of incidents (e.g. product withdrawal or recall).

The results of this verification must be documented and communicated to the HACCP or 
food safety team as part of the review process.

Verification should be completed to a planned schedule.

2.12.3 The HACCP food safety team shall review the HACCP or food safety plan and prerequisite 
programmes at least annually and prior to any changes which may affect food safety. As a 
guide, these may include the following, although this is not an exhaustive list:

• change in raw materials or supplier of raw materials
• change in ingredients/recipe
• change in processing conditions, cleaning and disinfection procedures, process flow or 

equipment
• change in packaging, storage or distribution conditions
• change in consumer use
• emergence of a new risk (e.g. known adulteration of an ingredient or other relevant, 

published information, such as the recall of a similar product)
• review following a significant product safety incident (e.g. a product recall)
• new developments in scientific information associated with ingredients, process, 

packaging or product.

Appropriate changes resulting from the review shall be incorporated into the HACCP or 
food safety plan and/or prerequisite programmes. Changes shall be fully documented, and 
the validation shall be recorded.

Where appropriate, the changes shall also be reflected in the company’s product safety 
policy and food safety objectives.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Review of the HACCP plan

The HACCP or food safety plan and associated prerequisite programmes must be reviewed 
regularly, at a minimum of once a year, even if there have been no changes to the product 
range or processing methods. Some or all of the plan should be reviewed whenever there is 
a significant change.

Changes that may affect product safety, such as those listed in this clause, need to be 
evaluated in the context of the plan before they are introduced, and the plan amended as 
necessary.

A procedure could be documented that lists the activities or changes which trigger a 
HACCP review, but this would have to be backed up by documented evidence that the 
review has actually been carried out (e.g. by documenting minutes of the meeting or an 
agreed action plan).

In the case of published incidents (e.g. recalls or media stories), it is good practice to 
consider whether the product involved is similar to those produced at the site, and therefore 
whether a similar problem could occur with the site’s products. Where a genuine risk is 
identified, the site should complete a review of the existing HACCP controls to establish 
whether they remain sufficient or whether amendments are required. However, it is not a 
requirement of the Standard to complete an in-depth analysis of every recall that occurs 
where no similarity or risk exists.

2.13 HACCP documentation and record-keeping (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius 
Step 12, Principle 7)

Clause Requirements
2.13.1 Documentation and record-keeping shall be sufficient to enable the site to verify that the 

HACCP and food safety controls, including controls managed by prerequisite programmes, 
are in place and maintained.

Interpretation HACCP documentation

Records must be kept to demonstrate that the HACCP or food safety plan, including the 
prerequisite programmes, is fully implemented. This must include all the steps in creating 
and reviewing the plan, records of control and monitoring procedures, and training records 
of staff.

Further details on record-keeping are available in the requirements in section 3.3 of the 
Standard and its interpretation.

3 Food safety and quality management system

3.1 Food safety and quality manual

The company’s processes and procedures to meet the requirements of this Standard shall be documented to 
allow effective, consistent application, facilitate training, and support due diligence in the production of a safe 
product.

Interpretation

A well-documented, systematic management system forms the basis for the product and process controls necessary 
to produce safe products, meet the requirements of the Standard, meet customer specifications and enable staff to 
be trained and informed.

In many instances, the Standard specifically states that requirements shall be satisfied by documented procedures; 
in others, this is implied as the company needs to ensure consistent application throughout the site and show that 
systems are in place to demonstrate food safety to external stakeholders (including regulatory authorities, customers 
and the BRCGS auditor). The Standard therefore requires policies, procedures, records, risk assessments, etc. , to be 
documented in sufficient detail to achieve these aims.

The Standard does not prescribe a review frequency for the food safety and quality manual, or the documents within 
it; however, good practice is to update the manual, or relevant parts of it, whenever there is a change to processes or 
procedures.

Clause Requirements
3.1.1 The site’s procedures, working methods and practices shall be collated in the form of a 

printed or electronic quality manual.

Interpretation The food safety and quality manual

Policies, procedures and work instructions must be in place, easily retrievable and available 
where needed, and must cover the requirements of the Standard. These documents must be 
collated into one or more quality manuals which form the reference point for all documents 
included in the food safety and quality system.

These documents may exist on paper (i.e. as hard copy) or may be controlled on an 
electronic system. In either case, they should be easy to follow and kept up to date.

In a small, simple operation, the manual may contain the majority of the procedures 
controlling the processes. In a complex operation it may contain the headline policies and 
indicate where more detailed operating instructions can be found.

The manual should include an overview of how the company’s policies and procedures are 
organised. This organisation should be understood by those using the documents and easily 
demonstrated. Where the site is part of a company governed by a head office, the interaction 
between the site’s documented system and that of the other sites and the head office 
should be clear. All policies and procedures necessary for the operation of the site being 
assessed must be available at that site.

There is no requirement for sites to have a quality manual that is numbered in accordance 
with the Standard’s numbering system.

Clause Requirements
3.1.2 The food safety and quality manual shall be fully implemented and the manual or relevant 

components shall be readily available to relevant staff.

Interpretation Availability of the manual to staff

The objective of this requirement is to ensure that key staff have access to up-to-date 
policies and procedures at all times and in the most appropriate format. For example, the 
incident management procedure should be available to the relevant team members via 
internet link, hard copy or other off-site format.

Staff needing such documents as part of their role within the company must always 
have access to them. During the audit the procedures documented in the manual will 
be evaluated against the actual practices on the site, with the expectation that they are 
followed correctly.

3.1.3 All procedures and work instructions shall be clearly legible, unambiguous, in appropriate 
languages and sufficiently detailed to enable their correct application by appropriate staff. 
This should include the use of photographs, diagrams or other pictorial instructions where 
written communication alone is not sufficient (e.g. there are issues of literacy or foreign 
language).

Interpretation Clear procedures and work instructions for staff

Procedures and work instructions must be documented in a clear and unambiguous format.

Anyone using an authorised document must be able to understand its relevance, what it is 
for and how to use it. Evidence is required to demonstrate that staff clearly understand the 
procedures as this will be challenged by the auditor.

Consideration may be given to providing procedures in appropriate languages, either written 
or oral, to ensure staff understand the documents and their role. Where translations are 
used, a record should be kept of who translated the information into which language(s). Both 
the translator and the recipient staff should sign the training record to indicate that the 
translated version has been understood.

Documentation should include the use of photographs, diagrams or other pictorial 
instructions where written communication alone is not sufficient. For example, diagrams 
added to cleaning instructions can show clearly which pieces of equipment to remove or 
focus on. Signs and pictures can be particularly useful for communicating personal hygiene 
and protective clothing requirements.

3.2 Document control

The company shall operate an effective document control system to ensure that only the correct versions of 
documents, including recording forms, are available and in use.

Interpretation

Documents must be effectively controlled to ensure that staff are working with the most up-to-date information 
and to minimise the potential for mistakes. Documents include policies, procedures, work instructions, records, 
forms, specifications, data lists and any information that is written down and defined. They may be available on paper 
(i.e. as hard copy) or in electronic format.

INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

Key documents found to be in use during the audit that have not been properly authorised or are not the correct 
version may lead to a non-conformity.

Clause Requirements
3.2.1 The company shall have a procedure to manage documents which form part of the food 

safety and quality system. This shall include:

• a list of all controlled documents indicating the latest version number
• the method for the identification and authorisation of controlled documents
• a record of the reason for any changes or amendments to documents
• the system for the replacement of existing documents when these are updated.

Where documents are stored in electronic form these shall also be:

• stored securely (e.g. with authorised access, control of amendments, or password protection)
• backed up to prevent loss.

Interpretation Documented management system

The control of all documents within the food safety and quality system (for both external 
and internal use) is important for several reasons, including:

• the documents are kept up to date
• staff are working with the correct version
• the potential for mistakes caused by multiple versions of a document is minimised.

Therefore all documents in use need to be properly authorised and must be the correct 
version.

The Standard requires the site to have a documented procedure that describes the method by 
which documents are controlled and managed. This procedure needs to include instructions 
on how the following features of the document management system are controlled:

• responsibilities for the management of the system
• list of all controlled documents, indicating the current version number and the allocation 

of controlled copies of the document (see below)
• identification of controlled documents (e.g. document ID, issue date, version number)
• records of the reason for any change(s) (see below)
• method of rescinding and replacing documents.

In order to demonstrate the control of document issue, it is necessary to maintain a 
register of all controlled documents, their allocation and issue status. Where the controlled 
documents are all contained on an electronic system, it is usual for printed versions to be 
marked as uncontrolled. Each copy must be authorised (e.g. with a signature or stamp) to 
show it is for use, and each must be given a version number so that out-of-date documents 
can be identified and removed. This must be evidenced by the fact that all documents in use 
are the most up-to-date versions.

Where documents are maintained electronically, the site is required to ensure that they are 
stored securely and cannot be amended by unauthorised persons; for example, by using 
individual passwords or security swipe cards. This includes backing them up appropriately to 
ensure no data is lost. The auditor will ask to see evidence (e.g. a procedure) that the site has 
an effective backup process, rather than auditing that the backup contains all the relevant 
files.

continued

The methodology or type of electronic storage is not specified. The site may choose to use 
an internal server to store data; or it may use cloud services, which are generally considered 
to be secure and backed up, providing there is control of authorised/authenticated users.

When a document is changed, a record needs to be made of the change and the reason for 
it. This can be achieved by keeping a copy of the previous version with the reason for the 
change written on it, or by keeping a history of amendments. Consideration should also be 
given to the most effective method of communicating the changes to staff; for example, by 
highlighting the change within the new document or training relevant staff.

Further guidance How to put a document control procedure in place

Firstly, ensure there is a single, clear, documented system that operates across all documents 
within the food safety and quality management system and that it includes the minimum 
requirements highlighted in the Standard:

• identification of the individual(s) responsible for management of the system (i.e. who is 
authorised to issue or amend documents). This might be someone with the authority to 
instigate and maintain the system

• the list of all controlled documents
• methods of identification of controlled documents
• records regarding the reasons for any changes
• the method of collecting and replacing documents.

List of documents

Your site needs a list of all the documents within the food safety and quality system. 
Typically this will include:

• the document identification or number. The Standard does not set out how you should 
identify your documents, but an example format would be using sequentially numbered 
documents or an initial letter (often representing a department or activity) followed by a 
number (e.g. P0123); Figure 6 shows an example

• the document title. Use a concise title that clearly explains the purpose or content of the 
document (e.g. ‘metal detector check procedure’)

• the current issue or version number. Each time the document is updated, amended or 
replaced, a new version number should be used

• the issue date. Include the date when the current version of the document first came into 
force

• withdrawal date (if applicable)
• review date (if applicable). Documents may require periodic review to ensure the 

information remains applicable and up to date
• the allocation of controlled copies (i.e. who has a copy of the document).

Identification and authorisation of your documents

The simplest way to identify your document is to include a footer on each page that 
contains the relevant information, as shown in Figure 7. This may include the:

• document reference
• issue or version number
• title of the document
• date of issue
• page number and total number of pages.

Figure 7  Typical formats for footers

You will need to include a method of authorisation too (e.g. a signature or a stamp that 
identifies genuine copies of the document). Where these are held electronically, it may be 
more convenient to label printed copies as uncontrolled copies.

Making changes to your documents

When a document is changed, you will need to make a note of the change and the reason for 
it. You can do this by:

• keeping a copy of the previous version with the reason for the change written on it, or
• keeping a ‘history of amendments’ log within each document; Figure 8 shows an example.

A new issue or revision always replaces an existing document. You must not have two 
different issues or revisions of the same document at any time.

You will also need to ensure that any policy or procedure changes are communicated to the 
relevant staff. This can be done by highlighting the change within the new document or by 
specific training prior to the issue of the new version.

Replacing your documents

You will need to keep a record of all controlled documents and their allocation. This will 
mean that whenever a document is updated or replaced, the person responsible can ensure 
each old copy is returned when the new version is issued. The easiest way to do this is by 
using a sign-off sheet where staff sign to indicate that they have returned the previous 
version and collected the new one.

3.3 Record completion and maintenance

The site shall maintain genuine records to demonstrate the effective control of product safety, legality and 
quality.

Interpretation

Records are documented information that provide permanent evidence about past events – particularly events 
concerning product safety, quality and legality. Records must therefore be maintained in an appropriate way to 
ensure they demonstrate control of systems and operations.

Where records are kept electronically, it is good practice to ensure that the IT management system facilitates good 
quality, secure, accurate record-keeping. For example, it should:

• include suitable systems for storing and backup of data (it may be useful to check the effectiveness of the system 
to restore data, e.g. as part of the incident management procedures detailed in section 3.11)

• define access and IT management responsibilities
• set a frequency of backup based on risk
• confirm the security of data storage.

Clause Requirements
3.3.1 Records shall be legible, maintained in good condition and retrievable. Any alterations to 

records shall be authorised and justification for the alteration shall be recorded. Where 
records are in electronic form these shall also be:

• stored securely (e.g. with authorised access, control of amendments, or password 
protection)

• suitably backed up to prevent loss.

Interpretation Record completion

Records must be legible and genuine; for example, they must be completed at the time of 
the checks (i.e. not before or after the event) and in an appropriate manner (e.g. using a pen, 
as pencil could be altered after the event). Records should be appropriately authorised; this 
may include the initials or signature of the operator or supervisor verifying the records.

Any alterations to records need to be justified and authorised. A suitable procedure must be 
in place to manage any mistakes that are made (e.g. neatly crossing through the ‘inaccurate’ 
information, noting the reason for the error and giving the initials of the person making 
the change). Note that the use of correction fluid is not acceptable as this makes the initial 
information illegible.

Records must be retrievable when required (e.g. during an audit or the investigation of a 
customer complaint), and must therefore be maintained and stored to allow this (e.g. by 
being appropriately filed by date or reference number and in such a way that they are still 
legible within the specified storage timeframe). They must be created in such a manner that 
they accurately transmit the intended information (e.g. they can be read by others and are 
traceable to the creator of the record via initials or signature).

Where records are stored electronically, this storage must be secure. The site should 
ensure that passwords or other mechanisms required to access records are known only by 
the people who need to use them. When using electronic systems, it may also be useful to 
assign different access levels; for example, for staff who can view records, and for those who 
can also add or amend existing data.

Electronic documents must be suitably backed up to prevent loss. Consideration should be 
given to testing electronic retrieval systems, and records of these tests should be retained.

3.3.2 Records shall be retained for a defined period with consideration given to:

• any legal or customer requirements
• the shelf life of the product.

This shall take into account, where it is specified on the label, the possibility that shelf life 
may be extended by the consumer (e.g. by freezing).

At a minimum, records shall be retained for the shelf life of the product plus 12 months.

Interpretation Record storage

The retention time for records must be established by the company, and procedures put in 
place for appropriate handling, so that records are retained in good condition for this period 
and are retrievable. Consideration should be given to the potential for degradation during 
storage (e.g. due to fading ink, degradation of thermal paper or breakdown of electronic 
media).

Records that may be called upon to demonstrate the safety, authenticity or legality of 
the product must be kept for an appropriate period. Examples of appropriate periods for 
products or ingredients are as follows:

• Final products  A period not less than the indicated shelf life plus 1 year.
• Ingredients (i.e. where the site sells an ingredient that will be used in the manufacture of a 

final product)  The shelf life of the final product plus 1 year. Where the final-product shelf 
life is not reasonably known, records should be kept for 3 years or a period agreed with 
customers.

• Products of an undefined shelf life (e.g. some wines and alcoholic drinks)  The company 
should define a reasonable record retention period based on experience of customer 
usage, time for complaints and any legal precedents. It would be usual for records to be 
kept for at least 3 years in these situations.

Additional retention time may be required by legislation, by customers or because of 
the nature of the product (e.g. extension beyond the normal shelf life by the inclusion of 
customer freezing instructions on the product packaging must be observed).

As records may be called upon by a customer as part of a legal defence, consideration 
should be given to the length of time that may pass from production of a product to 
notification of impending legal action in the country of sale.

Some regions have specific legal requirements. FSMA legislation, for example, requires a 
storage period of a minimum of 2 years for all documents and records relating to the food 
safety plan, and records must be retrievable within 24 hours, even when stored off site.

3.4 Internal audits

Fundamental
The company shall be able to demonstrate that it verifies the effective application of the food safety 
plan, and the implementation of the requirements of the Global Standard Food Safety and the site’s 
food safety and quality management system.

Interpretation

An internal audit is any audit completed by or on behalf of the company rather than by a second or third party. In 
second-party audits, the company carrying out the audit may have a commercial interest (e.g. a customer audit), while 
a third-party audit is generally conducted by an independent organisation (e.g. a certification body).

Internal audits are one of the most powerful self-assessment tools that a site has available; they are a key factor 
in ensuring continued compliance with the requirements of the Standard, and the operation of its food safety and 
quality management systems. They must therefore be regarded by the management of the company as critical to its

The internal audit programme can be used to:

• confirm that the product safety and quality management systems are correct and effective
• verify that product safety, authenticity, legality and quality activities and processes are being completed correctly 

(i.e. the actual work completed)
• monitor and confirm that products are manufactured correctly
• provide early identification of potential risks or potential non-conformities (sometimes referred to as near-misses), 

allowing timely correction such that they do not become actual non-conformities
• identify areas for improvement
• undertake verification of systems (a crucial step within the control of the HACCP or food safety plan; e.g. see 

clause 2.12.2).

The site’s attitude towards its internal audit programme is also likely to indicate its food safety and quality culture. 
For example, a site with a poor food safety culture may be tempted to:

• reduce the number of internal audits and inspections to the minimum, rather than the level indicated by thorough 
risk assessment

• under-report non-conformity and near-misses (i.e. find less than exist in reality)
• not follow up on non-conformities (e.g. corrective, preventive actions and root cause analysis).

The scope of the internal audit programme must cover all areas of the food safety and quality management system, 
including all the requirements of the Standard, implementation of the HACCP or food safety plan, prerequisite 
programmes and procedures, food defence and prevention of food fraud. It must also cover both the systems in 
place and the work practices.

It is not a requirement of the Standard that all of the internal audits in the programme are completed prior to the 
site’s BRCGS audit. However, the Standard does require the site to have a planned schedule, with audit dates spread 
throughout the year, and for the site to complete the individual audits according to this schedule (see details below). 
For sites that are already certificated the auditor may review the internal audits from the previous year, if the BRCGS 
audit occurs early in the year, and little of the current year’s schedule has been completed.

The Standard is not prescriptive on the type of auditing techniques used during internal audits, and the site may 
therefore choose the most applicable techniques for the activity being audited. For example, there are some areas 
that may be auditable remotely, while others are likely to require physical, on-site auditing techniques. Whichever 
techniques the site uses, it is still expected to have an effective audit programme. That means being able to 
demonstrate that the systems associated with the food safety plan, the Standard and the food safety and quality 
management system are operating effectively and as intended.

Clause Requirements
3.4.1 There shall be a scheduled programme of internal audits.

At a minimum, the programme shall include at least four different audit dates spread 
throughout the year. The frequency at which each activity is audited shall be established 
in relation to the risks associated with the activity and previous audit performance. All 
activities that form a part of the site’s food safety and quality systems, including those 
relevant to food safety, authenticity, legality and quality, shall be covered at least once each 
year.

The scope of the internal audit programme shall include, although this is not an exhaustive 
list:

• HACCP or food safety plan, including the activities to implement it (e.g. supplier approval, 
corrective actions and verification)

• prerequisite programmes (e.g. hygiene, pest management)
• food defence and food fraud prevention plans
• procedures implemented to achieve the Standard.

Each internal audit within the programme shall have a defined scope and consider a specific 
activity or a section of the HACCP or food safety plan.

Interpretation Internal audit programme

The scope of internal audits needs to be established and must ensure that all aspects 
of the food safety and quality management systems (including the HACCP programme, 
prerequisite programmes, policies, documentation, hygiene and production), the product 
safety and quality culture plan, and systems associated with authenticity, product legality 
and quality management are audited at least annually.

All the internal audits should not be conducted on a single day; nor should every internal 
audit attempt to cover all aspects of the food safety and quality management system or 
the Standard. A once-a-year check against all the requirements of the Standard may be of 
value as a gap analysis when preparing for an audit or confirming the contents of the food 
safety and quality management systems, but is insufficient to cover the full requirements 
of an internal audit programme as it will not provide the depth of assessment or level of 
confidence required.

Development of the internal audit schedule should begin with a risk assessment. The aim of 
this is to identify:

• all the areas or activities that need to be audited
• the frequency with which each part of the product safety and quality management system 

needs to be audited. This will be dependent on the risk inherent in each activity or section 
of the food safety and quality management system. For example, the site should be aware 
of the consequences of not complying with its own systems, which could lead to hazards 
not being identified in a timely manner. Therefore internal audits of CCPs are likely to be 
more frequent than those for less critical activities. 
Frequency may also be influenced by known issues within the company or customer 
requirements. This may result in a site needing to audit an activity multiple times 
throughout the year, or developing a programme with more than four internal audit dates 
(see below)

• the most relevant dates for each internal audit; for example, if activities or processes are 
seasonal (see below) or if specific activities need to be completed more than once a year. 
Sites may also find it useful to consider completing internal audits during different shifts, 
including, for example, nights or weekends.

The majority of sites are likely to benefit from a programme of audit dates spread diversely 
throughout the year, as this maximises the opportunity to identify any non-conforming 
processes in a timely manner, allowing correction and minimising the potential for standards 
to fall between audits. The Standard promotes this concept by requiring a minimum of 
four audit dates spread throughout the year. However, it does not require all audits to be 
completed quarterly, as there may be genuine situations where risk assessment shows an 
alternative frequency. Seasonality is an example; if a site is open only for part of the year, 
then there is little value in completing internal audits while the site is shut. For seasonal 
production, the site is not expected to complete a series of internal audits when the site is 
not operating; however, there must be a system for the management of start-up processes, 
and internal audits are therefore expected to start before the season commences to ensure 
the site is ready to start production. For example, the HACCP programme should be audited 
to ensure that it is up to date and appropriate for the forthcoming production; that hygiene 
and fabrication are correct; and that staff are appropriately trained. The remaining areas of 
the internal audit programme should be covered throughout the season. Further information 
is available in the BRCGS Fresh Produce Guideline available from BRCGS Participate or the 
BRCGS Store.

Even where a site is open throughout the year, seasonality can affect the internal audit 
dates; for example, if certain activities, such as the harvest of grapes or bottling of wine, are 
only completed at certain times, or if there are seasonal changes in production volumes 
which apply a greater burden on the product safety systems at certain times of year. Where 
a site is part of a multi-site company, and the company conducts annual corporate food 
safety audits, it is acceptable for this annual audit to be incorporated into the internal audit 
schedule. However, additional internal audits that look at specific parts of the food safety 
and quality system, and compliance with the Standard, should be scheduled throughout the 
rest of the year.

The most common way of completing an internal audit is by taking documented procedures 
and work instructions and comparing them with the actual working practices and records. 
Note that a tick-box exercise is not sufficient, as it does not provide the rigour or depth that 
an effective internal audit programme requires.

The use of an external consultant (e.g. by small sites) is acceptable, providing the internal 
audit programme is scheduled throughout the year and not in a single block of activity. 
See clause 1.2.4 and section 3.5.3 for details relating to the requirements for product safety 
consultants.

BRCGS has produced a guideline to internal auditing which is available on 
BRCGS Participate or from the BRCGS Store.

3.4.2 Internal audits shall be carried out by appropriately trained, competent auditors. Auditors 
shall be independent (i.e. not audit their own work).

Interpretation Auditor training and independence

Good auditing is a thorough, evidence-based assessment of an activity or system, completed 
by an independent auditor. It should ultimately contribute towards the site’s continuous 
improvement.

Auditing is therefore an acquired skill and auditors need to be trained and competent to 
ensure they are carrying out this function effectively. Training should include:

• auditing skills, such as how to complete an effective audit
• relevant technical knowledge of the activity to be audited, such as HACCP or appropriate 

product technical knowledge. This may be by work experience in the sector or specific 
training

• soft skills associated with auditing.

Internal auditors must be able to show via training records (clause 7.1.6) that they have 
received formal training on internal auditing, via either attendance at an external course or 
training within the company.

Training should also cover the planning and scheduling of the internal audits, preparing 
audit reports in the company’s agreed format, the correct use of audit techniques (e.g. 
documentation and process auditing, audit trails and discussions with colleagues) and 
follow-up of audit findings (see clause 3.4.3).

Training must be of sufficient duration and depth to ensure that auditors can complete 
robust, consistent audits.

External auditors may be used where internal resources are insufficient, providing the 
requirements of clause 3.4.1 can be met (for scheduling audits throughout the year). The site 
should refer to clause 1.2.4 and section 3.5.3 for the requirements for the management of 
food safety consultants.

Internal auditors must be independent of the process being audited. This is to ensure that 
there is no conflict of interest (i.e. that the audit is rigorous and thorough) and that any work 
needed to make corrections or improvements can be identified by an auditor who is not 
biased or influenced by working in the area. Internal auditors may not audit their own work 
or any programmes for which they are immediately responsible. It is not acceptable, for 
example, for workers on one shift to audit the work of another shift completing the same 
work, as they are not independent of the operation.

During the BRCGS audit, the auditor may discuss the process with internal auditors to 
establish their level of competence.

Sites may find it useful to calibrate their internal auditor team (e.g. at the beginning of the 
year, before a new schedule of internal audits begins) to ensure that there is a consistent 
approach across the company.

A number of sources of further guidance and training for internal auditors are available 
including:

• BRCGS guideline on internal auditing (see BRCGS Participate or BRCGS Store)
• BRCGS internal auditor training
• ISO 19011 Guidelines for auditing management systems.

Clause Requirements
3.4.3 The internal audit programme shall be fully implemented. Internal audit reports shall 

identify conformity as well as non-conformity and include objective evidence of the 
findings.

The results shall be reported to the personnel responsible for the activity audited.

Corrective and preventive actions, and timescales for their implementation, shall be agreed 
and their completion verified. All non-conformities shall be handled as detailed in section 
3.7. A summary of the results shall be reviewed in the management review meetings (see 
clause 1.1.4).

Interpretation Internal audit records and corrective actions

The management review processes (see clause 1.1.4) must ensure that the internal audit 
programme operates effectively and that necessary corrective or preventive actions are 
appropriately completed. As a result, the internal audit process will often contain a number 
of steps. For example:

• internal audit completed
• corrective actions agreed
• corrective actions completed and signed off
• completion verified
• root cause analysis used to identify any necessary preventive actions
• preventive actions completed and reviewed
• overall management review completed.

Each internal audit must examine the process or activity in detail and will usually include a 
number of activities such as:

• observing how activities are completed
• asking relevant staff how an activity is completed or why it is completed in a specific way
• reviewing procedures and records to confirm whether the activity has been completed and 

recorded correctly.

In addition to the actual internal audit, it is important that appropriate reports are 
completed, clearly indicating what was audited, the actions that are agreed and the review of 
these actions.

Reports must show evidence of conformity as well as non-conformity, with objective 
supporting evidence (e.g. what documents or actions were observed). Some sites have also 
found it useful to include recommendations for improvement, where the audit can highlight 
any that are noted during the audit.

Tick lists showing that items have been assessed will not normally be accepted as the 
only form of evidence; information showing how the audited items have fulfilled the 
requirements, or how they are non-compliant, is required. This is important, as recording 
conformity is documenting evidence that due diligence is taking place; in other words, 
that required procedures are taking place, and have been observed by auditors who are 
independent of the process. This may subsequently be useful, for example, in the event of 
an incident, or for answering questions from regulatory authorities or customers.

Notes, references or copies of the documents and records should be kept as evidence of 
aspects that have been examined, to allow an independent reviewer to reach the same 
conclusion as the internal auditor. For example, the dates and titles of records that were 
inspected should be noted in sufficient detail to allow them to be traced; if any records are 
non-compliant, precise details of the non-compliance should be given. The listing of records 
reviewed also ensures that a wide range of records are considered (e.g. training records of 
a variety of staff rather than repeated audits of the same records). Records will also confirm 
whether anything has changed since the last audit.

The Standard is not prescriptive regarding the format of the internal audit reports; for 
example, they may be hand-written, stand-alone electronic documents or uploaded into a 
company database. Good practice is to retain any auditor notes that are completed during 
the audit, as well as the final report. Figure 9 shows a typical example of a completed audit 
report.

The results of audits need to be communicated to the relevant staff; i.e. those who are 
responsible for the area or activity, and corrective actions, root cause and preventive 
actions and timescales for their completion agreed. This may be achieved via operational 
or review meetings, or via an update at the end of the audit combined with documentation 
such as a memo or a copy of the audit report. Responsibility for corrective actions must be 
documented – for example, by being recorded on the audit record sheet. Full details for 
handling non-conformities, including corrective and preventive actions, are provided in 
section 3.7.

Note that finding a non-conformity during an internal audit should not necessarily be 
viewed as a negative, since it allows the site to implement action before the non-conformity 
becomes a more serious problem.

Where non-conformities have been identified, effective completion of corrective and 
preventive action must be verified. Good practice is to ensure that a nominated member 
of staff with the appropriate authority checks that the action has been taken within the 
agreed timescale, and that this has rectified the problem sufficiently to prevent recurrence. 
The nominated staff member should not be the person responsible for completion of the 
actions; ideally this should be the original auditor.

Good practice is to complete a review of the internal audit programme; for example, looking 
at the outputs and trends, and any insight these provide. A summary of the programme and 
results will also be required for the management review meeting (see clause 1.1.4).

A non-conformity will be raised against clause 3.4.3 if there is a non-conformity in the 
operation of the internal audit programme itself. Examples include if the audit schedule is 
not properly implemented or if corrective and preventive actions are not completed within 
the agreed timescales.

Where the site consistently obtains negative results (i.e. no non-conformities are identified 
throughout the scheduled programme) good practice is to review the programme to ensure 
it is operating robustly; for example, to:

• consider if all activities are correctly incorporated into the programme
• review rigour, robustness and consistency of the internal audits.

Clause Requirements
3.4.4 In addition to the internal audit programme, there shall be a separate programme of 

documented inspections to ensure that the factory environment and processing equipment 
are maintained in a suitable condition for food production. At a minimum, these inspections 
shall include:

• hygiene inspections to assess cleaning and housekeeping performance
• fabrication inspections (e.g. doors, walls, facilities and equipment) to identify risks to the 

product from the building or equipment.

The frequency of these inspections shall be based on risk and on any changes that may 
affect food safety, but shall be no less than once per month in open product areas.

The results shall be reported to the personnel responsible for the activity or area audited.

Corrective actions, and timescales for their implementation, shall be agreed and their 
completion verified.

A summary of the results shall be reviewed in the management review meetings (see 
clause 1.1.4).

Interpretation Documented inspections

In addition to the internal audit programme the Standard requires a programme of 
documented inspections to ensure that the factory environment and processing equipment 
are maintained in a suitable condition. These inspections are different from the internal 
audit programme specified in clauses 3.4.1 to 3.4.3, which examines practices against 
documented procedures. Audits are an in-depth challenge to the systems and procedures 
that a site has put in place to manage hazards, to confirm that the site is effectively 
mitigating identified risks. A documented inspection, however, is a simpler approach to 
assessing the conditions present, so an entirely separate inspection plan should be in place.

These hygiene- and fabrication-based inspections assess standards of cleaning, equipment, 
building fabrication and personal hygiene to ensure that high standards are maintained and 
that a safe, hygienic production environment is in place. For example, inspections should 
include:

• appropriateness, status, state of repair and cleaning of doors, walls, floors and other 
fabrication and facilities (e.g. those detailed in section 4.4)

• hygiene inspection to confirm equipment and facilities have been suitably cleaned
• equipment inspection to identify and control potential foreign bodies (e.g. from worn or 

damaged equipment) before they have the opportunity to contaminate a product.

The frequency of the inspections should be based on risk. For open product areas, 
inspections need to be at least monthly, whereas inspections in high-care and high-risk areas 
are likely to be more frequent (e.g. daily or weekly); seasonal products or activities should be 
included where appropriate. Line start-up checks, which may occur daily or at shift changes 
in many operations, can form part of this inspection programme.

It is also good practice to complete inspections after any activities that potentially change 
the risk to products; for example, after maintenance.

A review of the inspection programme should be completed prior to any changes which may 
affect food safety; for example:

• introducing new equipment or facilities
• changes to products
• changes to processing conditions or process flow
• following a non-conformity in an audit (e.g. internal, BRCGS, customer, or regulatory audit) 

or an independent inspection (e.g. following recommendations for improvement from the 
pest control in-depth survey).

The individuals responsible for completing these inspections should be suitably trained 
for the systems they are checking. However, staff completing hygiene and fabrication 
inspections do not need the same level of training as internal auditors.

The absolute requirements for independence identified in clause 3.4.2 do not always apply 
to these inspections; for example, it would be acceptable for line start-up checks to be 
carried out by line supervisors or managers. External agencies may be used to carry out 
inspections.

It is important that issues identified at the inspections are corrected as soon as possible so 
that product risk is minimised. The records of inspections and corrective actions must be 
retained.

Inspection records can provide useful information to identify trends and drive 
improvements (e.g. through the use of scored inspection results). To facilitate this, and to 
promote discussions about improvements to hygiene and fabrication, a summary of the 
results will be discussed at the management review meetings (see clause 1.1.4).

3.5 Supplier and raw material approval and performance monitoring

3.5.1 Management of suppliers of raw materials and packaging

Fundamental
The company shall have an effective supplier approval and monitoring system to ensure that any 
potential risks from raw materials (including primary packaging) to the safety, authenticity, legality 
and quality of the final product are understood and managed.

Interpretation

All materials brought onto the site to become part of the final product must be sourced through approved suppliers 
and monitored. This approval process and programme for monitoring raw materials will consider the potential risk 
the material represents (in terms of safety, authenticity, legality and quality).

Primary packaging materials are also included in this requirement. Packaging is vital to product integrity in the 
packing environment, and during storage and distribution within the supply chain. Primary packaging is defined in the 
Standard as:

‘The packaging that constitutes the unit of sale to the consumer or customer (e.g. bottle, closure, label and tamper-
evident seal of a retail pack or a raw material bulk container).’ (A full explanation is available in the glossary.)

The supplier approval system must consist of an initial approval process and an ongoing monitoring process.

The risk assessment process should help to focus increased attention on the raw materials or suppliers that present 
a greater risk.

Clause Requirements
3.5.1.1 The company shall undertake a documented risk assessment of each raw material or group 

of raw materials, including primary packaging, to identify potential risks to product safety, 
authenticity, legality and quality. This shall take into account the potential for:

• allergens (allergen content and potential contamination)
• foreign-body risks
• microbiological contamination
• chemical contamination
• variety or species cross-contamination
• substitution or fraud (see clause 5.4.2)
• any risks associated with raw materials which are subject to legislative control or customer 

requirements.

Consideration shall also be given to the significance of a raw material to the quality of the 
final product.

The risk assessment shall form the basis for the raw material acceptance and testing 
procedure and for the processes adopted for supplier approval and monitoring.

The risk assessment for a raw material shall be updated:

• when there is a change in a raw material, the processing of a raw material, or the supplier of 
a raw material

• if a new risk emerges
• following a product recall or withdrawal, where a specific raw material has been implicated
• at least every 3 years.

Interpretation Raw material risk assessment

The aim of this clause is to ensure the potential risks to product safety, authenticity, legality 
and quality that could result from specific raw materials, have been identified, and where 
necessary mitigation measures put in place, for example, by adding controls into:

• supplier approval and purchasing processes
• goods receipt controls and product testing
• the food safety plan (HACCP) or specific parts of the food safety and quality management 

systems.

All proposed ingredients and packaging must be subjected to a documented assessment of 
their inherent risk.

This raw material risk assessment is not intended to be a duplication of other clauses. 
For example, the reference to authenticity is not intended to duplicate the requirements 
within section 5.4; the processes are intended to operate together. In other words, section 
5.4 should highlight any authenticity risks within the supply and identify suitable controls, 
whereas this clause is intended to bring those identified risks into the supplier approval, 
raw material management and raw material receipt processes. Similarly, this may form part 
of the HACCP or food safety plan; however, as this is an important starting point for the 
production of safe food, it needs to be detailed and will be specifically assessed by the 
auditor.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

The assessment may be of individual products or, where a number of raw materials share 
the same characteristics and likely risks, these may be grouped together. When grouping 
materials, each should still be considered separately to ensure that it does not have 
different risk factors from the rest of the group. Risk, and therefore the opportunity to 
group ingredients or not, may vary between factories and processes because of the different 
overall effect on quality. For example, in a bakery, all dried fruit may be considered to be of 
similar risk, but where flour is a critical ingredient, it may be necessary to consider each type 
of flour separately (e.g. white or wholemeal); however, other non-bakery sites may group all 
the types of flour together.

The Standard lists the minimum types of hazards that the company must consider, including:

• allergens – both the intended allergen content and the potential for the raw material to be 
contaminated should be included

• foreign-body risks – these maybe intrinsic or extrinsic (i.e. an inedible part of the raw 
material, such as bones in animal products; or materials from the growing environment or 
manufacturing processes)

• microbiological contamination
• chemical contamination – including contaminants that occur naturally in the environment, 

those that migrate from packaging materials, or artificial additions in the supply chain (such 
as pesticides or veterinary medicines)

• potential for variety or species cross-contamination (i.e. where the supplier handles 
multiple varieties of a product and inadvertent contamination could occur during 
processing

• the potential for fraudulent activity in the supply chain – for example, undeclared 
additions, dilution or substitution of the raw material or a component of it. (As discussed 
above, the identification of hazards and necessary control measures may be completed as 
part of the activities for section 5.4.)

• the risk of non-compliance with legal requirements specific to the product (e.g. banned 
substances) – it is important to remember that legislative requirements in the country 
of raw material production may be different from those of the country where the site is 
located or where the final product is intended to be sold

• any customer requirements.

Identification of the actual level of risk often requires the company to consider several 
factors; for example:

• access to reference information and an awareness of emerging food issues are essential to 
ensure all known risks are assessed (clause 1.1.8)

• how the ingredient is used (e.g. an ingredient added following the final microbiological kill 
step may present a different risk from an ingredient added at the beginning of a process)

• nature of the supplier
• historical evidence of the supplier and raw material
• geographic origins (products from particular origins may carry a greater risk due to 

environmental conditions, because of more relaxed local legal requirements or a less 
developed food safety culture)

• methods of manufacture/processing of the raw material (e.g. if a site is using egg as an 
ingredient, the microbiological risk will depend on whether fresh or pasteurised egg is 
used. Similarly, the type or level of processing may change the risks; for example, whole 
carcass, compared to cuts of meat, compared to cubes or mince or mechanically recovered 
meat)

• significance of the ingredient to the final product (e.g. some ‘safe’ ingredients, such as flour 
in breadmaking, may be fundamental to the performance of the product and therefore 
require higher levels of control to ensure consistent quality) and the spread of the 
ingredient in the company/final products

• customer or legislative requirements (e.g. suppliers may be specified by customers, but this 
does not negate the need for risk assessment)

• additional focus on raw materials where claims are being made about the final product 
(e.g. ‘organic’ or ‘suitable for allergy sufferers’) or where there is a microbiological risk from 
components added after heat treatment.

Sites should also consider the primary packaging materials used as they too are raw 
materials. There is potential for packaging materials to pose a problem, whether because of 
contamination, malicious intervention or the use of inappropriate materials.

Where different departments are involved in the process (e.g. head office or different 
sections of the site technical team), there needs to be a linked process to demonstrate 
the responsibilities of each team and how these work together to operate the system. The 
outcome of this risk assessment must also be considered when assessing the requirements 
for supplier approval and for monitoring and acceptance procedures (clause 3.5.1.2 and 
section 3.5.2).

Risk assessments must be up to date and the site must therefore review the assessment 
whenever there is a significant change (e.g. new suppliers, new raw materials, new countries 
of origin or an emerging risk) or where an incident (e.g. a product recall or withdrawal) is 
related to a specific raw material. At a minimum risk assessments must be reviewed every 
3 years.

Clause Requirements
3.5.1.2 The company shall have a documented supplier approval procedure to ensure that all 

suppliers of raw materials, including primary packaging, effectively manage risks to raw 
material quality and safety and are operating effective traceability processes. The approval 
procedure shall be based on risk and include either one or a combination of:

• a valid certification to the applicable BRCGS Standard or GFSI-benchmarked standard. The 
scope of the certification shall include the raw materials purchased

or
• supplier audits, with a scope to include product safety, traceability, HACCP review, 

the product security and food defence plan, the product authenticity plan and good 
manufacturing practices. The audit shall ensure that these plans form part of the supplier’s 
product safety management system and that any resultant actions are implemented. 
The supplier audit shall be undertaken by an experienced and demonstrably competent 
product safety auditor. Where the supplier audit is completed by a second or third party, 
the company shall be able to:
• demonstrate the competency of the auditor
• confirm that the scope of the audit includes product safety, product security and food 

defence plan, product authenticity, traceability, HACCP review and good manufacturing 
practices

• obtain and review a copy of the full audit report
or
• where a valid risk-based justification is provided and the supplier is assessed as low risk 

only, a completed supplier questionnaire may be used for initial approval. At a minimum, 
the questionnaire shall have a scope that includes product safety, product security and 
food defence, product authenticity, traceability, HACCP review and good manufacturing 
practices. The questionnaire shall have been reviewed and verified by a demonstrably 
competent person.

Interpretation Documented supplier approval and monitoring system

All suppliers must be evaluated for their ability to meet the specifications of the materials 
(ingredients and primary packaging) they are supplying and requirements for safety, quality 
and legality.

The company must document its procedure for supplier approval and monitoring. This needs 
to include the methods of approval, frequency of monitoring, responsibilities and how the 
process will be managed.

The acceptable methods of supplier approval will depend on the raw material and the risks 
associated with it (e.g. the output of clause 3.5.1.1). They will include one or more of the 
following activities:

• Certification to the relevant BRCGS Standard, such as the Global Standard Food Safety; 
Packaging Materials; Storage and Distribution; Agents and Brokers; or another of the 
GFSI-benchmarked schemes. The site must confirm the validity of the certification. This 
will include:
• Confirmation of the certification status (e.g. this can be confirmed on an independent 

database; for BRCGS Standards it can be confirmed in the BRCGS Directory). 
Photocopies of certificates are not recommended and on their own are not considered 
suitable validation of certification status. During the BRCGS audit the site may be asked 
to demonstrate its validation process.

• Confirmation that the certification remains up to date (e.g. by receiving confirmation of 
successful completion of the recertification processes or by recording certificate expiry 
dates and completing checks for ongoing certification).

• Ensuring that the raw materials are within the scope of the certification. Where the 
product has been excluded from the scope of certification it cannot be assumed that 
all of the processes relating to its manufacture have been conducted in accordance 
with the certification requirements. For example, different facilities or equipment may 
be used; different raw material suppliers or risk assessment; or different staff training. 
Therefore the site will need to undertake additional supplier approval processes to 
ensure the material is satisfactory and any risks are appropriately managed.

A successful site audit covers at a minimum product safety, traceability, HACCP, product 
security and the food defence plan (i.e. systems to protect the product from theft and 
malicious activity), product authenticity and good manufacturing processes. This audit must 
be completed by an appropriately experienced and competent auditor (i.e. someone who has 
completed training in auditing techniques, has experience of auditing, and has knowledge of 
the product, ingredient or processes being audited). Non-conformities should be addressed 
(e.g. in an agreed action plan with timescales) unless they are critical to product safety or 
legality, in which case supply should not be permitted until the non-conformities have been 
satisfactorily addressed.

When deciding the type of supplier audit to complete the company should consider the 
risks associated with the raw material and supplier, using this information to decide the 
format and duration of the audit, and whether the risk assessment indicates that some or 
all of the requirements can be completed remotely, or whether an entirely on-site audit is 
required.

If the raw material supplier is independently audited to another standard that is not GFSI-
benchmarked, this may be acceptable as an alternative to the site completing its own audit 
of the supplier providing that:

• the scope of the audit meets the requirements of the Standard (i.e. at a minimum product 
safety, traceability, HACCP review, product security and food defence, food authenticity 
and good manufacturing practices)

• the site has a copy of the full audit report (not just a certificate)
• the supplier can demonstrate the competence of the auditor.

Where risk assessment (completed as part of this clause) indicates that a supplier is low 
risk (e.g. due to history of trading with the site or the nature of the raw materials traded) 
the completion of a supplier questionnaire with a focus on food safety and quality may 
be sufficient. If a supplier questionnaire is the only mechanism used to assess a supplier 
(i.e. there are no additional activities such as supplier audits) then it is important that the 
questionnaire (and replies from the ingredient supplier) contains all the relevant information 
to allow the site to confidently make a decision on approval.

The auditor will expect to see, and will challenge, risk assessments.

Approval and the associated risk assessments must be up to date. The site should therefore 
consider reviewing the assessment whenever there is a significant change (e.g. new suppliers, 
new countries of origin or new materials).

Clause Requirements
3.5.1.3 There shall be a documented process for ongoing supplier performance review, based on risk 

and defined performance criteria. The process shall be fully implemented.

Where approval is based on questionnaires, these shall be reissued at least every 3 years 
and suppliers shall be required to notify the site of any significant changes in the interim, 
including any change in certification status.

Records of the review shall be kept.

Interpretation Ongoing monitoring

Although it is important to know how and why suppliers are approved, it is also vital to 
ensure that ongoing approval is justified. The site is free to determine how it confers 
continuing approval on its suppliers, but it is important that the site uses a risk-based 
approach.

The defined performance criteria can be determined by the site and should depend on the 
supplier’s performance. However, it is important that product safety, authenticity, legality 
and quality are included within all supplier reviews. Therefore, while a company may wish 
to include other criteria (e.g. financial considerations or reliability of delivery schedules) 
these additional criteria must not outweigh the need to fully assess food safety, authenticity, 
legality and quality considerations.

As a guide, typical criteria may include:

• known risks associated with the raw material or supplier
• supplier approach to emerging concerns
• incidences of contamination or non-conforming raw materials
• quality of material supplied.

The frequency of ongoing approval is also important, and this is left to the site to determine. 
However, where approval is based on supplier questionnaires, these must be reissued at 
least every 3 years. Good practice is to ensure that a system of proactive communication is 
in place, where suppliers inform the company of any changes or challenges.

The site must be able to demonstrate to an auditor that the monitoring and ongoing review 
it uses is appropriate, justified and risk-based.

3.5.1.4 The site shall have an up-to-date list or database of approved suppliers. This may be on 
paper (hard copy) or it may be controlled on an electronic system.

The list or relevant components of the database shall be readily available to the relevant 
staff (e.g. at goods receipt).

Interpretation Approved suppliers list

The company must also maintain an up-to-date list of approved suppliers based on the 
outcome of the supplier approval process. This list can either be in hard copy (i.e. paper) 
or electronic format (such as an approval database). It is expected that all purchased 
raw materials (including packaging) will be from the suppliers on the list unless it is an 
emergency purchase covered by clause 3.5.1.7.

The auditor may refer to the list to facilitate the effective sampling of supplier approval 
records.

The list (or relevant sections of it) should be available where goods are taken in, and be 
accessible to anyone who needs it at the points at which it should be used. This is likely to 
include purchasing where this activity is carried out at the site (i.e. not at a corporate facility).

3.5.1.5 Where raw materials (including primary packaging) are purchased from companies that 
are not the manufacturer, packer or consolidator (e.g. purchased from an agent, broker or 
wholesaler), the site shall know the identity of the last manufacturer or packer, or for bulk 
commodity products the consolidation place of the raw material.

Information to enable the approval of the manufacturer, packer or consolidator, as in clauses 
3.5.1.1 and 3.5.1.2, shall be obtained from the agent/broker or directly from the supplier, 
unless the agent/broker is themselves certificated to a BRCGS Standard (e.g. Global Standard 
Agents and Brokers) or a standard benchmarked by GFSI.

Interpretation Purchasing from agents and brokers

Potential product safety risks need to be understood for all raw materials, including those 
that have been purchased through an agent or broker (see glossary).

The purpose of this clause is therefore to ensure that essential information relating to 
traceability, product safety, authenticity, food defence, etc. is maintained and relevant details 
communicated, where a site has purchased a raw material from an agent or broker, or a 
wholesaler (i.e. not the manufacturer, packer or consolidator). The site will need sufficient 
information to:

• ensure traceability
• enable timely action in the event of an incident in the supply chain
• enable the approval of the last processor of the raw material, the last point of packing or 

the consolidation place for bulk commodity products, as described in clause 3.5.1.2.

The Standard is not prescriptive on the methods of communication used, and this 
information may be provided directly by the manufacturer, processor, packer or consolidator 
or alternatively through the agent or broker, depending on the contractual arrangements for 
data handling and communication agreed between the site and the agent/broker.

For the purposes of the Standard, a place of consolidation of bulk materials is a location 
where a number of smaller batches are mixed to form a single bulk material (e.g. where a 
number of farms supply grain, which the grain merchant combines in a silo before sale, or 
where a cooperative arranges for a group of small growers to combine their crops for onward 
sale to customers). The important difference between consolidation and other types of 
storage or trade of materials is the mixing or combining of materials from multiple sources 
or batches, so that it is no longer possible to identify the individual supplier/batch for any 
specific portion of the bulk material (of course, for traceability purposes, it must still be 
possible to identify all of the suppliers/batches contributing to the bulk). Therefore, where 
a trader receives individually traceable units of product (e.g. sacks of material), each of 
which can be individually traced from supplier to customer, this does not count as a place 
of consolidation. The bulk material may be sold to one customer or divided and sold to 
multiple customers.

Where the agent or broker is certificated to the Global Standard Agents and Brokers, the 
wholesale module of the Global Standard Storage and Distribution, the relevant traded 
products/goods scope of the Global Standard Food Safety or Global Standard Packaging 
Materials, or a GFSI-benchmarked equivalent, then the site simply needs to know the 
identity of the manufacturer, packer or place of consolidation of the material (i.e. the 
location/company where the material underwent the last process other than storage 
or distribution). In this situation, the requirement to approve the processor, packer or 
consolidator is not applicable, as the requirements of these Standards ensure that effective 
systems for supplier approval and traceability are in place. However, the site will still be 
expected to know the identity of the processor, packer or consolidator.

3.5.1.6 The company shall ensure that its suppliers of raw materials (including primary packaging) 
have an effective traceability system. Where a supplier has been approved based on a 
questionnaire instead of certification or audit, verification of the supplier’s traceability 
system shall be carried out on first approval and then at least every 3 years. This may be 
achieved by a traceability test.

Where the supplier is not the manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the raw material (e.g. 
purchased from an agent, broker or wholesaler) and approval is based on a questionnaire 
instead of certification or audit, the verification of the traceability system shall be carried out 
on the last manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the raw material.

Where a raw material is received directly from a farm or fish farm, further verification of the 
farm’s traceability system is not mandatory.

Interpretation Supply chain traceability

It is important for the integrity of products that appropriate traceability systems operate 
throughout the supply chain. Therefore sites must ensure that their raw material suppliers 
(including primary packaging suppliers) have suitable traceability systems in operation. This 
assurance can be obtained from certification, auditing or by directly testing traceability. 
Examples of acceptable traceability include:

• The raw material supplier is certificated to a GFSI-benchmarked standard. Assessment 
of traceability systems forms part of these audits and therefore no additional action is 
required to comply with the requirements of this clause; however, a communication 
mechanism should be in place, such that if the raw material supplier were no longer 
certificated, the site would be made aware of this change.

• The raw material supplier is audited by the site and the audit includes an assessment of 
the traceability systems. This would comply with the requirement as traceability has been 
assessed. The audit should be repeated at least every 3 years.

• Verification of a supplier’s traceability system where approval has been based solely on a 
questionnaire with no additional testing (unless the raw material is a primary agricultural 
product purchased directly from a farm or fishery, where additional testing of the 
traceability systems is not mandatory). This verification could include, for example:
• A test of the raw material supplier’s traceability. For example, as part of the site’s 

traceability test (see clause 3.9.3), a relevant ingredient is highlighted. The ingredient and 
batch details are forwarded to the supplier to enable them to complete the traceability 
test for the specific batch of raw materials and forward the relevant records back to the 
site.

• A worked example from the raw material supplier, which clearly explains the traceability 
process.

• A detailed description of the traceability system provided by the raw material supplier.

Information received during the traceability verification should be incorporated into the 
supplier approval process (clause 3.5.1.2).

Where the supplier is not the manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the raw material (e.g. 
purchased from an agent, broker or wholesaler) and approval is based on a questionnaire 
instead of certification or audit, the verification of the traceability system required by this 
clause shall be carried out on the last manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the raw 
material. Therefore, where the:

• agent/broker is certificated to a BRCGS Standard or a standard benchmarked by GFSI, the 
assessment of supplier approval forms part of these audits and therefore no additional 
action is required to comply with the requirements of this clause (see clause 3.5.1.5 for 
further information)

• last manufacturer, packer or consolidator is certificated to a BRCGS Standard or a standard 
benchmarked by GFSI, the assessment of supplier approval forms part of these audits and 
therefore no additional action is required to comply with the requirements of this clause

• last manufacturer, packer or consolidator is audited as part of the supplier approval 
process, and the audit includes an assessment of the traceability systems, this would 
comply with the requirement as traceability has been assessed.

Traceability verification is a requirement for each raw material supplier. Therefore any 
traceability test (because the supplier approval is based solely on a questionnaire) should 
be designed to test the raw material supplier’s systems and not to trace every single material 
they produce. Where a site purchases multiple ingredients from the same raw material 
supplier, it is not a requirement to complete a traceability test for every single ingredient 
purchased; only to complete the traceability test for each supplier from which ingredients 
are purchased.

The frequency of the traceability verification should link to the supplier approval 
programme; that is, the traceability is verified on first approval of the supplier, and then at 
least every 3 years. It is good practice to phase these verifications over the 3-year period 
rather than trying to complete them for all sites at once. Therefore sites that are new 
to certification (i.e. at their initial audit) may not have fully completed the traceability 
assessment for all of their suppliers, but should be able to demonstrate verification of the 
traceability system for at least a third of the suppliers in the first year, prioritising the higher-
risk materials; two-thirds completed within the second year; and all suppliers by the third 
year.

During the BRCGS audit the auditor will not undertake a test of raw material suppliers’ 
traceability systems but they will review the site’s processes and the information received 
from its raw material suppliers.

Issues arise with raw materials from time to time so it is beneficial to consider the 
monitoring of any materials that may need further transparency within the supply chain. 
This ensures that the site is proactive, not reactive, potentially mitigating the risk of future 
concerns about raw materials.

3.5.1.7 The procedures shall define the actions required in either of the following circumstances:

• an exception to the supplier approval processes in clause 3.5.1.2 occurs (e.g. where raw 
material suppliers are prescribed by a customer)

• information for effective supplier approval is not available (e.g. bulk agricultural 
commodity products).

In both the above situations, product testing is used to verify product quality and safety.

When a site produces customer-branded product, the customer shall be made aware of the 
relevant exceptions.

Interpretation Exception procedure

In cases where emergency supplies (e.g. where an established supplier is unable to fulfil an 
order), bulk commodity purchases or purchases from a supplier prescribed by a customer 
make it impossible to operate the approval processes in clause 3.5.1.2, the site must have a 
procedure detailing how these exceptions are to be handled. The process will include an 
assessment of the risk of the purchase and the completion of appropriate checks or tests to 
mitigate any risk. For example, this may include:

• 100% inspection of the product
• certificates of analysis
• increased microbiological sampling
• review of a third-party audit report
• a formally agreed specification
• confirmation of compliance with customer codes of practice.

Where raw materials are obtained from a customer-designated supplier (e.g. packaging or 
when contract packing), the site must ensure that information is obtained about the product 
and supplier so that potential risks to other products are assessed and controlled. Where 
the materials are used to produce a customer-branded product, the exceptions must be 
communicated to the customer.

3.5.2 Raw material and packaging acceptance, monitoring and management procedures

Controls on the acceptance of raw materials (including primary packaging) shall ensure that these do not 
compromise the safety, legality or quality of products and, where appropriate, any claims of authenticity.

Interpretation

Verification procedures need to be in place to demonstrate that materials (including ingredients and primary 
packaging) from approved suppliers meet agreed specifications and do not compromise the safety, legality, quality or 
authenticity of products.

Clause Requirements
3.5.2.1 The company shall have a procedure for the acceptance of raw materials and primary 

packaging on receipt based upon the risk assessment (clause 3.5.1.1). Acceptance of raw 
materials (including primary packaging) and their release for use shall be based on either one 
or a combination of:

• product sampling and testing
• visual inspection on receipt
• certificates of analysis (specific to the consignment)
• certificates of conformance.

A list of raw materials (including primary packaging) and the requirements to be met for 
acceptance shall be available. The parameters for acceptance and frequency of testing shall 
be clearly defined, implemented and reviewed.

Interpretation Acceptance of raw materials

The acceptance or goods-in system must include a documented procedure which requires 
checks to be completed and any non-conformities recorded. The procedure should 
document:

• who is authorised to accept conforming materials and reject non-conforming batches
• the checks and tests that must be completed, and at what frequency
• the acceptance criteria (e.g. the maximum or minimum values for tests that need to be 

completed)
• management of non-conforming product (this should also include ingredients that must 

be kept ‘on hold’ pending further testing or investigation), and the actions to be taken.

In the first instance raw materials are normally checked for the accuracy of the order; for 
example:

• visual inspection (e.g. for cleanliness, damaged packaging and spills, pest infestation, pallet 
condition)

• to ensure that the correct materials and quantity have been delivered
• to confirm the grade of material delivered
• to confirm that the raw material matches the specification
• to assure that the shelf life meets the minimum requirements
• the traceability of the raw material can be maintained (e.g. that appropriate traceability 

information has been received).

In addition, specific checks will be based on the risk assessment (clause 3.5.1.1) and the 
specification (section 3.6), and will include one or more of the following:

• specific raw material testing to ensure conformance with the specification before 
acceptance or use

• temperature checks (particularly for chilled or frozen materials) and storage instructions 
(refrigeration, freezing, or segregation for allergens)

• the accuracy of printed packaging and labels
• sampling (where required) which should include the timing, method and responsibility for 

completion, as well as retention of samples
• certificates of analysis specific to the consignment (i.e. specific to batch, date or lot codes 

included in the delivery) showing results relevant to the identified risks
• certificates of conformance specific to the consignment

Figure 11  Example of a goods-in acceptance sheet

Following the goods receipt checks the site will need to take appropriate action to manage 
the ingredient. Typically this will be one of the following:

• Accept the batch of ingredient, enter it into the site’s systems for traceability and stock 
control and move it into the appropriate storage area until it is required for production. It 
is important that temperature-sensitive ingredients are moved in a timely fashion and not 
left sitting in goods receipt for a prolonged period.

• Put the batch of raw material ‘on hold’ awaiting further paperwork from the supplier, 
product testing or quality assurance release. The site will need to have a clear policy on 
labelling and taking action to ensure materials that are on hold are not accidentally used.

• Reject the batch of raw material as it does not meet the required standards. The 
appropriate site representative will need to contact the raw material supplier and agree 
the next steps.

Again, a clear procedure is needed to ensure the ingredient is either segregated and labelled 
to ensure that it is not accidentally used, or is not off-loaded from the delivery vehicle.

Clause Requirements
3.5.2.2 Procedures shall be in place to ensure that approved changes to raw materials (including 

primary packaging) are communicated to goods receipt personnel and that only the correct 
version of the raw material is accepted. For example, when labels or printed packaging have 
been amended, only the correct version should be accepted and released into production.

Interpretation Communicating changes to goods receipt

It is common for raw materials, including primary packaging, to change throughout the life 
of a product because of the nature of supply or changes to the product. When this occurs, 
this requirement is designed to ensure that changes are communicated throughout the 
organisation so that only the relevant materials are shipped onto the site to eliminate the 
risk of accidental inclusion of out-of-date raw materials or packaging in the product.

The Standard does not prescribe the methods used, and it is common for a site to use a 
mixture of procedures; for example, using and checking unique raw material codes which are 
changed when a raw material changes.

This is particularly pertinent with packaging materials where print has been changed to 
reflect changed raw materials and, potentially, allergens. Good practice would ensure that 
approved packaging samples are supplied to the goods-in team with the relevant part codes 
that can be visually checked by goods receipt staff.

It is worth noting that the procedures developed for this clause will need to work with a 
number of clauses throughout the Standard, including, for example:

• clause 5.2.2 – the design of packaging and labels, which includes the need for checks of 
the accuracy of the printed information

• clause 5.5.3 – mechanisms to ensure that obsolete packaging is disposed of in a timely 
fashion and not incorrectly or accidentally used

• clause 6.2.1 – mechanisms to ensure that only the correct packaging is delivered to the 
production line.

3.5.3 Management of suppliers of services

The company shall be able to demonstrate that where services are outsourced, the service is appropriate and any 
risks presented to food safety, authenticity, legality and quality have been evaluated to ensure effective controls 
are in place.

Interpretation

Supplier approval must include the suppliers of services that could potentially affect product safety, authenticity, 
legality or quality; for example, the use of agencies to provide temporary staff, laundries, maintenance of equipment 
(e.g. refrigeration units), waste removal or transport.

Clause Requirements
3.5.3.1 There shall be a procedure for the approval and monitoring of suppliers of services. Such 

services shall include, as appropriate:

• pest control
• laundry services
• contracted cleaning
• contracted servicing and maintenance of equipment
• transport and distribution
• off-site storage of ingredients or packaging (other than at the supplier’s facilities) prior to 

delivery to the site
• off-site packing of products
• laboratory testing
• catering services
• waste management
• providers of product safety training
• product safety consultants.

This approval and monitoring process shall be risk-based and take into consideration:

• risk to the safety and quality of products
• compliance with any specific legal requirements
• potential risks to the security of the product (i.e. risks identified in the vulnerability and 

food defence assessments).

Interpretation Approval and monitoring of service providers

The site must document its procedure for the risk-based approval and monitoring of 
suppliers of services to ensure that these suppliers are competent and capable of providing 
the service to the required level.

Approval may include a combination of the following:

• membership of a recognised trade association which specialises in the service provided 
(e.g. pest control)

• historical experience with the supplier
• legal registration (e.g. waste licences)
• third-party certification to a recognised standard (e.g. the Global Standard Storage and 

Distribution)
• evidence of training and competence in food safety.

For example, where the site wishes to contract an external product safety consultant, the 
site may decide to:

• have a clear policy/procedure for the selection of consultants
• document a contract highlighting the consultant’s role and availability (see clause 3.5.3.2)
• establish the qualifications, competency and experience of the consultant, and confirm 

these are acceptable for the intended role
• consider the potential product safety, authenticity, legality and quality risks associated 

with the consultant’s role within the site.

It may be appropriate to undertake audits or questionnaires where a service is performed off 
site and may present a food safety risk (e.g. laundry services for high-risk/high-care clothing).

Clause Requirements
3.5.3.2 Contracts or formal agreements shall exist with the suppliers of services that clearly define 

service expectations and ensure that the potential food safety risks associated with the 
service have been addressed.

Interpretation Contracts with service providers

Contracts or formal agreements must be in place for the service providers detailed in clause 
3.5.3.1 to ensure the correct level of service is provided.

Service providers who will be on site will need to receive appropriate training to ensure they 
complete their activities in a way that will not negatively impact on the safety, quality or 
legality of products being manufactured (clause 7.1.1).

3.5.3.3 There shall be a documented process for ongoing performance review of suppliers 
of services, based on risk and defined performance criteria. The process shall be fully 
implemented.

Records of the review shall be kept.

Interpretation The performance of the supplier should be formally reviewed at a frequency appropriate to 
the service.

For example, a cleaning service could be assessed as part of the internal audit process 
(section 3.4) and records maintained of feedback on performance to the cleaning company. 
Other services, such as pest control or laundry, may be reviewed with the supplier on a 
6-monthly or annual basis and a record kept of the review (e.g. minutes of the meeting).

3.5.4 Management of outsourced processing

Outsourced processing (also referred to as ‘subcontracted processing’) is defined as where intermediate production, 
processing, storage or any intermediate step in the manufacture of a product is completed at another company or 
another site.

Note that outsourced processing refers to an intermediate step – therefore during outsourced processing the 
product or partly processed product leaves the site being audited for the completion of the outsourced processing, 
before returning to the site. The audited site may or may not complete additional packing or processing steps on the 
product.

Where there is additional storage or processing of raw materials prior to their initial arrival on site, this is not 
considered outsourced processing, but should be managed by the site using supplier approval, raw material risk 
assessments and raw material specifications.

Where a product leaves the site and does not return to it, this is not outsourced processing, and the activities 
completed off site are outside the scope of the audit.

Where any intermediate process step (including production, processing or storage) in the manufacture of a 
product is outsourced to a third party or undertaken at another site, and subsequently returned to the site, this 
shall be managed to ensure it does not compromise the product safety, authenticity, legality or quality.

Interpretation

This section applies to products that are included within the scope of a site’s certification but which have a process 
step that is outsourced to another company or site. This includes products or intermediates that are partially 
processed at another location (even a site within the same organisation or group) before being returned to the 
site. This typically happens when there is a need for specialist equipment (e.g. agglomeration of powders or freeze 
drying); alternatively the product may be sent to a region with a lower-cost economy for a very labour-intensive part 
of the process.

The scope of the report and any certificate will only reflect the activities undertaken at the site where the audit was 
undertaken. Therefore, packing of products by third parties (e.g. contract packing) and products that are entirely 
manufactured at a separate site (i.e. where co-manufacturing occurs), rather than just part of the manufacturing 
process being outsourced, are not covered by these requirements, since in both of these situations, the individual 
sites may be separately certificated and traceability coding should be able to identify at which site the product was 
manufactured.

For example, consider a simple manufacturing process, as shown in Figure 12.

Clause Requirements
3.5.4.1 The company shall be able to demonstrate that, where part of the production process (i.e. 

any intermediate process step) is outsourced or undertaken off site, and subsequently 
returned to the site, this has been declared to the customer and, where required, approval 
granted.

Interpretation Brand owner approval

Customers (e.g. brand owners) must be notified of any intention to outsource part of the 
production process. (Some customers require the opportunity to formally approve or reject 
this type of outsourcing.) For example, if this is clearly detailed on the approved product 
specification, then it would demonstrate that the customer has agreed the process.

This requirement is not limited to retail-branded products or to certain markets but applies 
to any product manufactured on behalf of a customer.

3.5.4.2 The company shall ensure that outsourced processors are approved and monitored, to 
ensure that they effectively manage risks to product safety and quality and are operating 
effective traceability processes.

The approval and monitoring procedure shall be based on risk and include either one or a 
combination of:

• a valid certification to the applicable BRCGS Standard or GFSI-benchmarked standard. The 
scope of the certification shall include the activities completed for the site

or
• supplier audits, with a scope to include product safety, traceability, HACCP review, product 

security and food defence plan, product authenticity plan and good manufacturing 
practices. The audit shall ensure that these plans form part of the supplier’s product 
safety management system and that any resultant actions are implemented. The supplier 
audit shall be undertaken by an experienced and demonstrably competent product safety 
auditor. Where this supplier audit is completed by a second or third party, the company 
shall be able to:
• demonstrate the competency of the auditor
• confirm that the scope of the audit includes product safety, traceability, HACCP 

review, product security and food defence plan, product authenticity plan and good 
manufacturing practices

• obtain and review a copy of the full audit report.

There shall be a documented process for ongoing supplier performance review, based on 
risk and defined performance criteria. The process shall be fully implemented. Records of the 
review shall be kept.

Interpretation Outsourced processor approval

The company must document its procedure for approval and monitoring of outsourced 
processors. This needs to include the methods of approval, frequency of monitoring, 
responsibilities and how the process will be managed.

The acceptable methods of approval will depend on the nature of the activity performed 
and its associated risks, and will include one or more of the following:

• Certification to the relevant BRCGS Standard or another of the GFSI-benchmarked 
schemes. The site must confirm the validity of the certification. This will include:

• Confirmation of the certification status (this can be confirmed, for example, on an 
independent database; for BRCGS it can be confirmed in the BRCGS Directory). 
Photocopies of certificates are not recommended and on their own are not considered 
suitable validation of certification status. During the BRCGS audit the site may be asked 
to demonstrate its validation process.

• Confirmation that the certification remains up to date (e.g. by receiving confirmation of 
successful completion of the recertification processes or by recording certificate expiry 
dates and completing checks for ongoing certification).

• Ensuring that the activities are within the scope of the certification.
• A successful site audit covers at a minimum product safety, traceability, HACCP 

review, product security and food defence plan, product authenticity plan and good 
manufacturing processes. This audit must be completed by an appropriately experienced 
and competent auditor (i.e. someone who has completed training in auditing techniques, 
has experience of auditing, and has knowledge of the product, ingredient or processes 
being audited). Non-conformities should be addressed (e.g. in an agreed action plan with 
timescales) unless they are critical to product safety or legality, in which case supply 
should not be permitted until the non-conformities have been satisfactorily addressed. 
If the outside processor is independently audited to another standard that is not GFSI-
benchmarked, this may be acceptable as an alternative to the site completing its own audit 
of the processor providing that:
• The scope of the audit meets the requirements of the Standard (i.e. at a minimum 

product safety, traceability, HACCP review, product security and food defence plan, 
product authenticity plan and good manufacturing practices).

• The site has a copy of the full audit report (not just a certificate).
• The processor can demonstrate the competence of the auditor.

The auditor will expect to see, and will challenge, risk assessments.

The site must be able to demonstrate to the auditor that the monitoring and ongoing review 
it uses is appropriate, justified and risk-based.

3.5.4.3 Where any processes are outsourced, including production, manufacture, processing or 
storage, the risks to the product safety, authenticity and legality shall form part of the site’s 
food safety plan (HACCP plan).

Interpretation The HACCP (or food safety plan) is the foundation of product safety processes and it 
is therefore vital that any outsourced processing is incorporated into the HACCP plan 
to ensure that any risks to product safety, authenticity and legality are identified and 
appropriate controls applied.

3.5.4.4 Requirements for outsourced processing shall be agreed and documented in a service 
specification (similar to a finished product specification). This shall include any specific 
handling requirements for the products.

Interpretation The company must ensure that product safety, authenticity, legality and quality are 
maintained during outsourced processing and the return of products to the site.

Therefore a service specification shall be in place for all outsourced processes, which details 
the activities to be completed and any specific handling requirements needed to maintain 
the safety, authenticity, legality or quality of the product.

Clause Requirements
3.5.4.5 Any outsourced processing operations shall:

• be undertaken in accordance with established contracts which clearly define any 
processing requirements

• maintain product traceability.

Interpretation Contracts and traceability

Contracts must be in place for the approved processors detailed in clause 3.5.4.2 to ensure:

• the correct level of service is provided
• the processing requirements are clearly defined in terms of the work to be undertaken, the 

product, ingredient specification, and any relevant safety, quality, legality or authenticity 
requirements.

There must be documented mechanisms to ensure traceability is maintained throughout the 
process.

Records relating to the traceability of individual batches of processed ingredient or product 
must be available.

3.5.4.6 The company shall establish inspection and test procedures for products where part of the 
processing has been outsourced, including visual, chemical and/or microbiological testing.

The frequency and methods of inspection or testing shall depend on risk assessment.

Interpretation Acceptance and test procedures

A documented acceptance procedure must identify the checks to be made when outsourced 
processing is complete. When products that have been processed are returned to the site, 
this procedure could form part of the goods receipt system.

Acceptance procedures may, for example, include:

• visual inspection
• chemical, microbiological or allergen testing
• hold/release requirements for the specific material (e.g. to allow additional testing or 

quality assurance checks).

The requirements (both acceptance methods and the frequency of any checks or tests) must 
be based on risk assessment of the nature of the ingredient or product, the process and 
the outside processor undertaking the processing; for example, the processor may handle 
allergens that could potentially contaminate the processed product.

The acceptance procedure must document any non-conformities, the person(s) authorised 
to accept conforming materials and reject non-conforming batches, and the action to be 
taken in the event of a non-conformity.

3.6 Specifications

Specifications shall exist for raw materials (including primary packaging), finished products and any product or 
service which could affect the integrity of the finished product.

Interpretation

The company must be assured of the quality of the products purchased. This includes any raw material or service 
that can affect food safety – for example, water and cleaning chemicals used, as well as services such as pest control, 
cleaning services or distribution.

Specifications for in-house intermediate products (work in progress) must be developed where they need to be 
checked and where they have an impact on product safety, authenticity, legality and quality.

A finished product specification must exist for all products covered under the certification scope, which ensures that 
required legislation and customer expectations are achieved.

Specifications must also be available for any product or service that can affect the integrity of the finished product. 
These should be sufficiently detailed to allow the company to understand and agree the product or service 
parameters; for example, specifications for cleaning chemicals should contain details on the components, usage 
instructions and material safety data.

Current specifications must be available for relevant personnel in order to ensure the specifications are being 
appropriately fulfilled. This may be the complete specification or parts thereof, or relevant details may be developed 
as production reference sheets, such as simple photographic specifications.

Clause Requirements
3.6.1 Specifications for raw materials and primary packaging shall be adequate and accurate and 

ensure compliance with relevant safety and legislative requirements. The specifications shall 
include defined limits for relevant attributes of the material which may affect the quality or 
safety of the final products (e.g. chemical, microbiological, physical or allergen standards).

Interpretation Raw material and packaging specifications

Specifications for all raw materials, including primary packaging materials, must be provided 
and adequately detailed. They must include the defined limits for all parameters critical to 
the safety, legality and quality of the product. They must also include details of packaging.

The specifications may be in the format provided by the supplier or in the company’s own 
format, as long as the information controlling the product’s quality and safety are clearly 
defined.

3.6.2 Accurate, up-to-date specifications shall be available for all finished products. These may be 
in the form of a printed or electronic document, or part of an online specification system.

They shall include key data to meet customer and legal requirements and assist the user in 
the safe usage of the product.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Finished product specifications

Specifications must be in place detailing all finished products. These specifications must be 
up to date (i.e. they must accurately represent the current version of the product) and should 
be reviewed whenever changes occur to the product, process or formulation. Good practice 
is therefore to ensure that the company has a system of change control where changes in 
products are identified before manufacture commences, that relevant amendments are made 
to the specification in a timely manner and that only the correct version of the specification 
is available to staff (see clause 3.6.4 for further details).

The format of the specifications should be agreed with the customer to ensure that 
all relevant customer requirements are incorporated. This may, for example, be printed 
documents, electronic files or an online database. In the case of the company’s branded 
products, it is acceptable to have an internal specification setting parameters for the 
manufacture of a product and a technical data sheet for customer use containing the key 
information for the safe use of the product, including but not limited to:

• ingredients, including the presence of allergens
• nutritional information
• preparation or cooking instructions
• storage instructions
• shelf-life/code information
• quantity.

Specifications must be accurate and the control of amendments and approval of 
specifications should therefore be laid down in a documented procedure. This procedure 
should also detail who can approve the amendments.

3.6.3 Where the company is manufacturing customer-branded products, it shall seek formal 
agreement of the finished product specifications. Where specifications are not formally 
agreed, the company shall be able to demonstrate that it has taken steps to ensure formal 
agreement is in place.

Interpretation Formal agreement of specifications

Customer-branded, finished product specifications must be formally agreed with the 
relevant customer and must, wherever possible, be signed by both parties. However, where 
the customer’s signature or approval is not formally available, proof that specifications 
have been issued (such as an email request for formal acknowledgement or specifications 
on customer IT specification systems) is required. In this situation the site must be able to 
demonstrate it is following a formal process agreed with the customer.

3.6.4 Specification review shall be sufficiently frequent to ensure that data is current or at a 
minimum every 3 years, taking into account product changes, suppliers, regulations and other 
risks.

Reviews and changes shall be documented.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Review of specifications

Specifications must be reviewed whenever changes occur to the product, process or 
formulation. Where no known changes have occurred, the specifications must be reviewed 
at least every 3 years, or more frequently if required by a specific customer, to ensure they 
remain completely up to date and accurate. Evidence that a review has been completed 
needs to be available and this should be achieved through the addition of a signature and 
date to the specification or through the use of a matrix showing specifications and the latest 
review date and reviewer.

The control of the amendment and approval of specifications should be laid down 
in a documented procedure. The procedure should also detail who can approve the 
amendments.

Some sites, companies or customers use cloud-based services which are able to notify 
the user when there has been a change to the data. In these cases, the site should have 
a mechanism to review the specification or change to understand whether there is any 
impact to product safety, the HACCP or food safety plan, or the production processes. This 
requirement is also reflected in clause 2.12.3, which explains how the HACCP or food safety 
plan needs to be reviewed whenever raw materials change.

3.7 Corrective and preventive actions

Fundamental
The site shall be able to demonstrate that it uses the information from identified issues in the food 
safety and quality management system (e.g. non-conforming products, internal audits, complaints, 
product recalls, product testing, second- and third-party audits and online reviews) to complete 
necessary corrective actions and prevent recurrence.

Interpretation

The objective is to ensure there are clear procedures to deal with problems that have the potential to affect safety, 
authenticity, legality or quality, ensuring that the finished product and consumer safety are not compromised.

Corrective and preventive actions are applicable to a wide range of non-conforming situations; they are not limited 
to BRCGS audit results, non-conforming products and complaints. The statement of intent therefore includes some 
examples of situations in which corrective and preventive actions are required, but this list is by no means definitive. 
The aim is for information from all issues associated with the safety and quality management system to be used to 
make improvements, not just those requiring immediate action.

Clause Requirements
3.7.1 The site shall have a procedure for handling and correcting issues identified in the food 

safety and quality management system.

The site procedures shall include the completion of root cause analysis and implementation 
of preventive action.

There must be a documented procedure for handling issues in the food safety and quality 
system which have a potential adverse effect on product safety, authenticity, legality or 
quality. All issues or non-conformities generated by the site (e.g. non-conforming product, 
internal audits and site inspections, third-party audits or customer complaints, product 
recalls, product testing (including inspections, quality assurance tests and laboratory 
testing)) must be subject to corrective action.

Good practice is for corrective action to be completed as soon after detecting the non-
conformity as possible (this is particularly important where the non-conformity could affect 
product safety, legality or quality – see clause 3.7.2).

An important part of an effective corrective action process is the identification of the root 
or underlying cause of the non-conformity and the implementation of suitable action to 
prevent recurrence. Root cause analysis is a process of conducting an investigation into an 
identified problem to allow the investigator(s) to understand the fundamental cause and put 
it right. While there are a number of techniques for undertaking root cause analysis, one of 
the most common and simplest to use is the ‘five whys’ technique. The technique is based 
on repeatedly digging deeper into the cause of a problem by asking ‘Why …?’ to get to the 
root of the issue. Usually, the root cause becomes evident after five steps, but this is not 
fixed and further investigation should be completed where required. This is described in 
more detail in the example in clause 3.7.2.

Some clauses in the Standard specifically require root cause analysis but it is up to the site 
to establish a procedure for its completion. Root cause analysis procedures should include:

• a set of parameters that will initiate the use of an appropriate tool (i.e. the site must define 
when the analysis will be completed if it is not already prescribed by the Standard)

• who is trained and/or authorised to complete the analysis
• the methods that the site will use to conduct the analysis
• the records which detail the analysis and any subsequent preventive actions
• the methods for the verification of the completed actions.

The auditor will expect to see a documented procedure that includes this information, as 
well as evidence of any root cause analysis and preventive action that the site has carried 
out.

It is worth noting that in some geographies the analysis of trends may be a legal 
requirement. For example, in the EU, the Microbiological Criteria for Foodstuffs (EC) No 
2073/2005 states that food business operators (FBOs) shall analyse trends in test results. 
When they observe a trend towards unsatisfactory results, they shall take appropriate 
actions without undue delay to remedy the situation in order to prevent the occurrence of 
microbiological risks.

Clause Requirements
3.7.2 Where a non-conformity places the safety, authenticity or legality of a product at risk, or 

where there is an adverse trend in quality, this shall be investigated and recorded including:

• clear documentation of the non-conformity
• assessment of consequences by a suitably competent and authorised person
• the corrective action to address the immediate issue
• completion of root cause analysis to identify the fundamental cause (root cause) of the 

non-conformity
• appropriate timescales for corrective and preventive actions
• the person(s) responsible for corrective and preventive actions
• verification that the corrective and preventive actions have been implemented and are 

effective.

Root cause analysis shall also be used to prevent recurrence of non-conformities, and to 
implement ongoing improvements when analysis of non-conformities for trends shows 
there has been a significant increase in a type of non-conformity.

Interpretation Non-conformities with associated safety, authenticity, legality or quality risks

Non-conformities with the potential to affect product safety, authenticity, legality or 
quality must be recorded, and the responsibility for investigating the cause of problems and 
ensuring that an adequate response is taken must be assigned to specified personnel.

Action needs to be undertaken as soon as possible after the detection of the non-
conformity, but there may also be a need for long-term action to prevent further occurrence 
of the non-conformity. All actions undertaken must be documented.

The records will include:

• details of the non-conformity and when it occurred or was identified
• assessment of the potential consequences of the non-conformity by a suitably competent 

and authorised person
• details of the action taken to address the immediate issue and dates or timescales for 

completion of the actions (i.e. corrective action)
• root cause analysis to identify the fundamental or root cause of the non-conformity
• details of the preventive action taken to address the root cause and dates or timescales for 

completion of the actions
• identification of who is authorised and responsible for the actions
• details of the verification checks to ensure the action has been implemented and is 

effective.

Where there is a significant trend in a specific type of non-conformity, root cause analysis 
must be used to investigate the trend and implement action to prevent recurrence.

All corrective actions should be completed in a timely fashion. In practice this will depend 
on the nature of the activity and the potential consequences of a delay. For example, 
stopping the production line would happen immediately but receiving and fitting a new or 
replacement part may be a prolonged process.

The actions should be included in a regular review of activities and systems.

The site must assess the consequences of any delay in action and ensure that product 
integrity and safety are not jeopardised. Where set timescales are not met, the reason for 
the delay should be recorded and reviewed by the appropriate site management to ensure 
ongoing product safety and, where necessary, provide appropriate resources.

Example Root cause analysis using the ‘five whys’ technique

An operator is instructed to perform a simple action, ‘Weigh out ingredient A’. However, the 
operator inadvertently uses ingredient B instead. The immediate reaction would probably be 
that this was operator error. Although this may be accurate, it does not establish the reason 
why the error occurred or prevent it from happening in the future. Using the five whys 
technique, the root cause analysis should ask and answer a series of questions:

• Why did the operator make the error? The operator was unfamiliar with the procedure.
• Why was an operator who was unfamiliar with the procedure asked to complete it? He 

had been trained but there was no supervision or sign-off of the training to confirm it was 
satisfactory.

• Why was the training not satisfactory? The two ingredients looked identical.
• Why weren’t the ingredients clearly labelled? The labels had been removed during 

cleaning and not replaced.
• Why weren’t the labels replaced? The cleaning staff did not consider the significance of 

the delay or the potential for an error.
• Why were the ingredient containers being used if they had not been set up correctly for 

manufacture? Checking the labels did not form part of anyone’s duties.

The conclusion of a root cause analysis should be to identify what should be changed to 
prevent recurrence of the error. In this example, the conclusion might be to:

• update the training procedure
• introduce a training sign-off procedure to ensure training is understood
• replace labels – if practical, with ones that cannot be removed. Where labels must be 

removed occasionally, ensure that post-maintenance line checks include a check of 
signage

• ensure that an individual (e.g. the production manager) is authorised and responsible for 
post-cleaning line sign-off

• ensure that cleaning staff fully understand and are trained in the need to return labelling 
(and all equipment) to a fully operational state.

Now that the root cause analysis has been completed, it is easy to see how this incident 
occurred. The causes were:

• an incomplete training procedure
• a faulty cleaning process
• lack of post-cleaning check procedures.

The next step of the process is for the site to identify and implement suitable preventive 
action to ensure the problem does not occur again (where a non-conformity has multiple 
causes it is important that the preventive action addresses all of these). For example:

• update the training procedure to ensure sign-off ( and possibly a supervision step)
• replace ingredient labels ideally with ones that cannot be removed
• if labels must occasionally be removed, ensure that post-cleaning line checks include a 

signage check
• ensure an individual is authorised and responsible for post-cleaning line sign-off
• ensure cleaners fully understand and are trained in the need to return labelling (and all 

equipment) in a fully operational state.

3.8 Control of non-conforming product

The site shall ensure that any out-of-specification product is effectively managed to prevent unauthorised 
release.

Interpretation

The objective is to ensure there are clear documented procedures to deal efficiently with any non-conformity that 
has the potential to affect product safety or quality. There is also a need to ensure that any non-conforming product 
or raw material is physically removed from the production process.

Clause Requirements
3.8.1 There shall be procedures for managing non-conforming products. These procedures shall 

include:

• the requirement for staff to identify and report a potentially non-conforming product
• clear identification of a non-conforming product (e.g. direct labelling or the use of IT 

systems)
• secure storage to prevent accidental release (e.g. physical or computer-based isolation)
• management of any product returned to the site
• referral to the brand owner where required
• defined responsibilities for decision-making on the use or disposal of products 

appropriate to the issue (e.g. destruction, reworking, downgrading to an alternative label or 
acceptance by concession)

• records of the decision on the use or disposal of the product
• records of destruction where a product is destroyed for food safety reasons.

Interpretation Management of non-conforming product

The control of non-conforming product must be described in a documented procedure 
(in this context the implicated product could be any material, such as an ingredient, final 
product, packaging, or a combination of these). Procedures must include:

• ensuring that all staff are aware of the need to report issues that may affect product safety, 
authenticity, legality or quality, and to whom. This may be covered as part of the induction 
process for production staff

• the system for labelling and identification of non-conforming product. This may include 
both direct labelling and computer-based records.

• segregation or isolation of non-conforming product. Ideally, the product must be 
physically segregated by moving it to an identified area within the production site, or 
clearly marked so that it cannot be confused with in-process material or finished product. 
The use of electronic inventory systems to ‘electronically isolate’ the material is also 
acceptable. It is often good practice to confirm the effective control of remaining product 
by completing a documented inventory; i.e. verifying the amount of non-conforming 
product that has been isolated with the quantities recorded in the production and 
dispatch records.

• procedures for handling returned product; for example, goods receipt actions, secure 
storage and notifications of returned product to relevant managers.

continued

• referral to the brand owner where required. The brand owner may need to be notified 
of quality issues and would expect to be contacted where issues affect product safety. 
Agreement may need to be reached before the held products are released for sale. 
Contacting brand owners is not usually necessary where the decision is to destroy, 
downgrade or rework product, unless this notification is a contractual requirement of the 
brand owner

• details of staff responsibilities, including which staff are authorised and responsible for 
decisions relating to non-conforming products. The final decision on what to do with 
held product should be taken by an experienced, technically competent manager. Only 
a limited number of personnel must have the authority to lift the hold notice or remove 
product from the isolation area

• records of all products placed on hold. These must include:
• details of the product quantity and code
• the reason for isolation
• action taken or required to assess the suitability of the product
• the final decision on what to do with the product; for example, rework, downgrading or 

destruction of the product
• the name of the person authorising the decision and date
• confirmation of the action taken
• any further actions required to prevent recurrence (this may link to an investigation of 

corrective actions; see section 3.7)
• the ‘on hold’ procedure employed while an investigation is completed
• procedures for the effective safe disposal of product.

It is usual to maintain a log of products which are on hold and to undertake periodic physical 
checks of held stock to ensure that accidental release has not occurred. The summary of 
products held and actions taken must be reviewed as part of the management review process.

Non-conforming product is a key prompt to initiate root cause analysis, particularly when 
there has been an increase in incidents of the same type (e.g. mis-packing).

3.9 Traceability

Fundamental
The site shall be able to trace all raw material product lots (including primary packaging) from its 
suppliers through all stages of processing and dispatch to its customers and vice versa.

Interpretation

As well as being a legislative requirement, traceability is a risk management tool, allowing food businesses and 
authorities to withdraw or recall products that have been identified as unsafe. It is therefore a fundamental 
requirement. A traceability system needs to be established at all stages of production, processing and distribution, 
identifying from whom raw materials have been obtained and to which customers finished product has been 
supplied. Note that the Standard requires forward and backward traceability throughout the production process. This 
means that the site should know where the material has come from (i.e. the direct supplier) and to whom finished 
product is dispatched.

There is no requirement for the site to trace raw materials all the way back to the source (e.g. farm) unless the source 
is the direct supplier to the site.

The system must ensure that products supplied to customers are adequately labelled or identified to facilitate 
traceability. Traceability details need to be retained in a format that allows access in a timely manner.

BRCGS has published a traceability guideline which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at 
BRCGS Participate.

Clause Requirements
3.9.1 The site shall have a documented traceability procedure designed to maintain traceability 

throughout the site’s processes. At a minimum this shall include:

• how the traceability system works
• the labelling and records required.

Where applicable, the traceability system shall meet the legal requirements in the country 
of sale or intended use.

Interpretation Traceability procedure

Sites are free to utilise their own traceability systems; no specific tool or technique 
is required by the Standard. Nevertheless, it is imperative that the site documents its 
traceability procedure so that it can be used and understood by the relevant personnel. This 
is particularly important at times of stress, when it is likely that the procedure will be relied 
upon to ensure at-risk product is identified and recalled or withdrawn in a timely manner.

Some countries have specific legislation relating to traceability. The site will therefore need 
to ensure that any legislative traceability requirements in the country of sale or intended use 
are met.

3.9.2 Identification of raw materials (including primary packaging), intermediate/semi-processed 
products, part-used materials, finished products and materials pending investigation shall be 
adequate to ensure traceability.

Interpretation Identification of raw materials and finished product

Products and materials may be identified by physical labelling, by recording systems 
identifying the allocation of materials to production or mixing areas, or through the use 
of computerised bar-coding systems. The level of traceability may need to be agreed 
between the company and its customers, but the system used must be capable of linking 
all raw material lot codes to finished product codes. This will enable finished product to be 
identified if a particular batch of raw material needs to be recalled.

The limitations of any system must be recognised, as can be demonstrated by the problems 
associated with bulk storage. Products such as sugar may be delivered with clear batch 
identification; however, if they are emptied into a single storage tank that is mixed with 
earlier deliveries, the reduction in accurate traceability is compounded by the potential 
for product to be trapped in dead zones during filling and emptying. If a particular delivery 
is identified as being contaminated, the entire product in the storage tank would need to 
be disposed of, as well as several lot codes of finished product, as the company would not 
be able to identify the specific batch of finished product that contained the contaminated 
material. A similar limitation will exist if recyclable packaging is collected from several 
sources and combined to form a single batch.

The traceability system needs to include primary packaging (a full definition of primary 
packaging is available in the glossary, Appendix 1). Note that processing aids (i.e. substances 
that are used within the process but are not required to be declared as an ingredient, such as 
sodium alginate for the clarification of beer) are included in the definition of raw materials 
(see glossary, Appendix 1) and therefore need to be included in the traceability system.

All test results (clause 3.9.3) must be traceable to specific batches of product or ingredient.

Consider how the traceability system operates in practice (with the effective physical 
identification of ingredients and products). For example, if bulk containers are labelled, 
consider how the information is presented to ensure it is legible and accurate. Common 
non-conformities include the ineffective labelling of part-used packs in production, work in 
progress, and storage areas leading to potential errors.

Strict controls on material identification, traceability and segregation are also required to 
preserve the integrity of any claims made, such as organic status. Where logos are used that 
make specific claims about production systems (e.g. farm assurance), full traceability must be 
demonstrated (see also section 5.4).

Apart from batch or lot codes, traceability information will usually include date codes to 
ensure that only ingredients, intermediates and products within the appropriate shelf-life 
period are used. Particular care is needed for decanted ingredients, work in progress and 
products stored in bulk where the packaging has been removed.

3.9.3 The site shall test the traceability system across the range of product groups to ensure 
traceability can be determined from the supplier of raw material (including primary 
packaging) to the finished product and vice versa. For food raw materials and finished 
products (i.e. including printed packaging and labels with food safety and legal information), 
the test of the traceability system shall include a quantity check/mass balance.

The traceability test shall include a summary of the documents that should be referenced 
during the test, and clearly show the links between them. The test shall occur at a 
predetermined frequency, at a minimum annually, and results shall be retained for 
inspection. Traceability should be achievable within 4 hours.

Interpretation Tests of the traceability system

Good practice is for the site to have a procedure or document that highlights the traceability 
system that is used at each step in the production process. It could include, for example, 
how incoming raw material batch numbers are captured, and how the outgoing product is 
traced and labelled. The process flow diagram developed as part of the HACCP plan (see 
clause 2.5.1) may be useful to ensure all steps are captured.

The site’s traceability system must be tested at least annually, or more frequently if required 
by a customer. (Note that the frequency of traceability tests relating to provenance and 
origin claims is covered separately in clause 5.4.5.)

Where traceability for all products manufactured by the site is the same or similar, then a 
minimum of one traceability test a year must be completed. However, if there are significant 
differences or specific traceability challenges relating to one product or group of products, 
additional tests specifically related to that product or group of products may be needed.

Traceability testing may be completed as part of a real product recall or withdrawal 
scenario if one has occurred, since the objective is to test the system and identify areas for 
improvement, rather than supply records of a ‘test’ for its own sake.

The system must provide traceability forwards and backwards; therefore the system should 
be tested in both directions. For example, a raw material could be selected and traced 
forwards to show in which finished products it was used. A finished product should also 
be selected and traced backwards to show all the raw material batch codes (including 
primary packaging) that were used to produce it. The tests should include identifying 
which customers received the finished products and which suppliers provided the raw 
materials. The traceability test must also include the traceability of the primary packaging 
materials. Although there are many benefits to complete supply chain traceability (i.e. from 
the farm through all stages of processing, distribution and storage, through to the retailer 
or food service company), this clause does not require sites to complete full supply chain 
traceability tests. The scope of the traceability test required here is from the suppliers of the 
raw material, through the site’s processes, to the site’s customers.

The site is also expected to compile a summary of the documents that should be referenced 
during the test, and clearly show the links between them. This is of benefit to both the 
site and the auditor, as it ensures all relevant documents are retrieved, and explains the 
traceability system.

The test of traceability should be timed and full traceability would be expected to be 
achieved within 4 hours. This is to reflect the need for rapid traceability in the event of a 
recall. Where traceability takes longer than 4 hours, review the areas where the retrieval of 
information is slow in order to identify improvements.

For all food products, and printed packaging and labels which have product safety 
information, the tests must also include a quantity check or mass balance exercise. It is not 
expected that the full mass balance exercise would always be achievable within 4 hours. The 
objective is to be able to account for the usage of a full batch of a raw material. This helps 
to ensure that the traceability systems are capable of operating effectively should a product 
recall be required based on the recall of an ingredient.

The mass balance exercise is usually undertaken as follows:

• Select a batch code of a particular specific raw material.
• Identify the quantity of the raw material supplied under that batch code.
• Identify the recipes in which the ingredient is used.
• Use production schedules and batch make-up sheets to calculate the quantities of the 

selected batch of ingredient used in each product.
• Calculate the quantity of any unused part of the batch in the warehouse.
• Reconcile the quantity delivered against the amounts used plus any residual unused stock.

In some instances quantity checks may take a great deal of time and resource to complete 
successfully.

It is unlikely that the mass balance exercise will be able to account for all materials to 
100% accuracy. However, the company needs to justify any discrepancies and demonstrate 
understanding of the nature of the variance. This may be inherent in the product 
characteristics (e.g. dehydration of fresh ingredients), or be ascribed to typical wastage on 
equipment or portion variances. Where the site adds subsequent deliveries to a bulk silo, 
the test should clearly show how this has been managed. The principle is to ensure that 
the traceability system is effective. Mass balance is a key measure of its workability and 
highlights areas for improvement.

During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will ask the site to complete at least one ‘vertical’ audit. 
At a minimum this will include the traceability of a specific batch of product or ingredient 
through the site’s production, processing and distribution processes, and a review of the 
site records related to the product or ingredient. Records will include, for example, supplier 
approval, goods receipt, process records (such as temperature monitoring), metal detector 
checks and dispatch records.

However, the vertical audit is not expected to include records that would only be held at 
other points in the supply chain (e.g. the raw material supplier’s processing records). This 
vertical audit is in addition to the review of the site’s own traceability tests. The final audit 
report will include a summary of the vertical audit results.

The vertical audit will also include a mass balance exercise and a review of the systems 
relating to the accuracy of labelling (clause 5.2.1). Further information on the content of 
the audit, including the vertical audit, can be obtained from BRCGS’ auditing techniques

BRCGS publishes a separate best-practice guideline on traceability, which may be purchased 
from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate.

3.9.4 Where rework or any reworking operation is performed, traceability shall be maintained.

Interpretation Rework

Many sites undertake rework or recycling activities, where raw materials, work in progress or 
final product that has left the normal production but is still safe, legal and of the appropriate 
quality, is reprocessed. There may be several reasons for completing rework, including to:

• reincorporate the material into a batch of the same product (either the batch currently 
being manufactured or to enable the materials to be stored for inclusion in a future 
production)

• incorporate the material into a batch of another product with similar ingredients
• process the material to meet the requirements of an alternative customer.

Where rework is undertaken, procedures must be in place to ensure that traceability is 
maintained.

3.10 Complaint-handling

Customer complaints shall be handled effectively and information used to reduce recurring complaint levels.

Interpretation

Complaints are key sources of information, informing the site of potential concerns and providing the opportunity 
for continual improvement; for example:

• in the event of a complaint relating to product safety, authenticity, legality or quality, they may require escalation 
into emergency plans such as a product withdrawal or recall

• the company’s attitude to complaints and complaint-handling processes may indicate the company’s product 
safety and quality culture; for example, the timeliness and robustness of complaint investigation and the 
appropriateness of any actions.

Therefore, an effective complaint-handling system needs to be operated by the company. The objective of the 
complaint investigation process should be to identify and correct causes of complaints, and one measure of an 
effective system should be a reduction in the number of complaints as a proportion of production volume.

Clause Requirements
3.10.1 All complaints shall be recorded and investigated, and the results of the investigation of 

the issue recorded where sufficient information is provided. Actions appropriate to the 
seriousness and frequency of the problems identified shall be carried out promptly and 
effectively by appropriately trained staff.

Interpretation Documentation and action

The company should ensure there is a clear process for customers (and potentially 
consumers) to raise legitimate complaints about the products. This is usually via the contact 
information on product labels. Where products are supplied into food service or through 
intermediaries, every effort should be made to ensure that complaints raised are relayed to 
the complaints department of the site.

All complaints need to be captured to a specified location to ensure they are adequately 
assessed and investigated, and the results of this investigation recorded. A documented 
complaints procedure is therefore required and the inclusion of a standardised complaint 
form may be useful.

Complaints must be handled by appropriately trained staff to ensure that a proactive 
system identifies the severity, and therefore the significance, of any complaints received. 
Actions must be appropriate to the seriousness of the complaint. A rapid response would be 
required for serious issues (such as a glass complaint) or where a number of complaints are 
received, suggesting a widespread problem.

Investigation must be completed within a defined timeframe and feedback provided to the 
complainant wherever contact details are provided.

3.10.2 Complaint data shall be analysed for significant trends. Where there has been a significant 
increase in a complaint, or a serious complaint, root cause analysis shall be used to 
implement ongoing improvements to product safety, legality and quality, and to avoid 
recurrence. This analysis shall be made available to relevant staff.

Interpretation Trend analysis

Data on customer complaints must be analysed to identify trends. A root cause analysis 
must be carried out where there is evidence of an emerging trend or a serious complaint. 
This is to help ensure problems are identified and improvements made to prevent 
recurrence as far as practicable.

This may include, for example, an analysis of foreign-body complaint types as complaint 
numbers per number of units produced, with data by shift or by production line. This 
data must be communicated to relevant staff and may include graphical displays on staff 
noticeboards or discussion at routine operations meetings.

Trend analysis may demonstrate that certain complaints are associated with customer 
abuse of the product (e.g. not following cooking instructions). A root cause analysis of these 
complaints should be undertaken to establish whether the underlying cause can be managed 
by the company. For example, could on-pack instructions be made clearer to reduce 
customer abuse and therefore the number of complaints?

3.11 Management of incidents, product withdrawal and product recall

The company shall have a plan and system in place to manage incidents effectively and enable the withdrawal and 
recall of products should this be required.

Interpretation

Incidents are events that may result in the production of unsafe, illegal, non-conforming product or products that 
are not authentic, and risks to consumer safety. An emergency situation may also occur as a result of a sudden, 
unforeseen crisis that requires immediate action. An effective emergency plan must be in place so that if at any 
stage an incident occurs that impacts food safety, authenticity, legality or quality, it will be managed effectively. 
The incident may be directly related to the product, the disruption of key services such as power and water, or 
environmental influences such as fire or flood.

The plan must be understood by relevant staff and must be routinely tested so that it can readily be put into 
practice, as incidents occur when least expected. The importance of a tried and tested procedure, ensuring that 
personnel know who does what and when, cannot be underestimated.

Clause Requirements
3.11.1 The company shall have procedures designed to report and effectively manage incidents 

and potential emergency situations that impact food safety, authenticity, legality or 
quality. This shall include consideration of contingency plans to maintain product safety, 
authenticity, legality and quality. Incidents may include:

• disruption to key services such as water, energy, transport, refrigeration processes, staff 
availability and communications

• events such as fire, flood or natural disaster
• malicious contamination or sabotage
• product contamination indicating a product may be unsafe or illegal
• failure of, or attacks against, digital cyber-security.

Where products which have been released from the site may be affected by an incident, 
consideration shall be given to the need to withdraw or recall products.

Interpretation Documented incident and emergency procedures

In the event of an incident or emergency situation, the company must be ready to instigate 
actions as promptly and efficiently as possible. Therefore the site must have a documented 
incident management plan. The objective of the plan must be to minimise risk to consumers 
and potential disruption to business. Systems must be in place and used to ensure that

information is collated and quickly assessed by staff who understand its significance and 
who can develop an appropriate action plan. The site might establish a crisis management 
plan that could address the points listed here, and any additional risks which are outside the 
scope of the Standard.

A documented incident management procedure is required. Although it may not be possible 
to detail exactly what action will be taken, as this will depend on individual circumstances, 
the company should consider:

• standard responses to a range of potential disasters, such as fire, flood or the loss of 
essential services

• the provision of alternative resources for energy, water, transport and any potential options 
for subcontracting production

• how to handle acts of potential malicious contamination or extortion
• management of unsafe or illegal products; for example, due to contamination or 

authenticity concerns
• details of staff responsibilities, including which staff are authorised and responsible 

for making decisions relating to non-conforming products. The number of incident 
management team members should be appropriate for the size of the business

• a plan to handle the logistics of product traceability and the recovery or disposal of 
affected product and stock reconciliation (i.e. comparing the amount of implicated 
product with the amounts known to have been destroyed, returned or retained in storage)

• methods to communicate with key contacts, both internal and external, such as telephone 
and email contact details (including office hours and out-of-hours details)

• the communication process, and the way in which enquiries from customers and the media 
are handled (this can be critical to the effective management of the situation and ultimate 
business recovery)

• corrective action that needs to be taken before production can recommence
• root cause analysis and preventive actions. Sites should reference their root cause 

procedure (clause 3.7.1), so that relevant preventive actions can be completed
• procedures to withdraw or recall affected products.

These details must be kept up to date by periodic verification. Customers and suppliers may 
need to be involved in the development of documented procedures as they may have their 
own requirements for crisis planning.

With more data being stored digitally and in cloud services, the site needs to be aware that 
such data is valuable to those who might extort or blackmail companies. Even though cloud 
services can be relatively secure, digital attacks and failures of systems pose a significant 
risk and the site needs to ensure that digital data is secure by using, for example, password 
protection, anti-virus software, firewalls and/or data backup systems.

Some organisations have published advice on cyber-security; for example, the National 
Cyber Security Centre’s 10 Steps to Cyber Security.

Good practice following an actual recall is to assess the effectiveness of the plan to identify 
and implement any appropriate learning or improvements. This process can form part of the 
evidence of compliance with clause 3.11.3.

Clause Requirements
3.11.2 The company shall have a documented product withdrawal and recall procedure. This shall 

include, at a minimum:

• identification of key personnel constituting the recall management team, with clearly 
identified responsibilities

• guidelines for deciding whether a product needs to be recalled or withdrawn and the 
records to be maintained

• an up-to-date list of key contacts (including out-of-hours contact details) or reference 
to the location of such a list (e.g. recall management team, emergency services, suppliers, 
customers, certification body, regulatory authority)

• a communication plan including the provision of information to customers, consumers and 
regulatory authorities in a timely manner

• details of external agencies providing advice and support as necessary (e.g. specialist 
laboratories, regulatory authority and legal expertise)

• a plan to handle the logistics of product traceability, recovery or disposal of affected 
product, and stock reconciliation

• a plan to record timings of key activities
• a plan to conduct root cause analysis and to implement ongoing improvements, to avoid 

recurrence.

The procedure shall be capable of being operated at any time.

Interpretation Documented withdrawal and recall procedure

A product recall is defined as any activity that involves the return of an unfit product from 
customers and final consumers, whereas a withdrawal is the return of out-of-specification 
or unfit products from customers, but not from final consumers (see glossary for full 
definitions).

The site must have a documented recall and withdrawal procedure. At a minimum, it must 
include:

• details of the recall management team members, including their roles, responsibilities 
and contact details. In larger businesses the recall team will involve head office personnel 
and it may be run from the head office. In this case the links between the production-site 
management and the recall team need to be clear

• guidelines for deciding whether a product needs to be recalled or withdrawn and the 
records to be maintained. Although causes for recall are often unpredictable, defined 
responses to known risks (e.g. identification of pathogens in routine product sampling) 
could be documented

• an up-to-date list of key contacts (e.g. recall management team, suppliers, customers, the 
certification body and regulatory authorities). A recall may occur at any time; therefore 
office hours and out-of-hours contact details must be provided

• a communication plan including the provision of information to customers, consumers 
and regulatory authorities in a timely manner. The communication process and the way in 
which enquiries from customers and the media are handled can be critical to the effective 
management of the situation and ultimate business recovery. The use of professional 
resources to assist in communication management may sometimes be advisable

• details of external agencies providing advice and support as necessary (e.g. specialist 
laboratories, regulatory authorities and legal expertise)

• a plan to handle the logistics of product traceability, recovery or disposal of affected 
product and stock reconciliation

• a log of activities created as the event unfolds and real-time observations, which could, 
for example, be used in discussions with customers or regulatory authorities. This may be 
valuable during a post-incident review to consider improvements to incident management 
processes

• reference to the root cause analysis procedure, so that relevant preventive actions can be 
introduced.

In the event of a product recall, it is obviously important that actions are completed in a 
timely fashion. Therefore, the aim of noting key times in the plan is to ensure that this will 
happen during both tests of the system and during any actual incident. There are various 
times that should be recorded, including:

• when the incident or test started
• times of internal communications and key decisions
• when traceability and mass balance exercises were started and completed
• communication to customers or regulatory authorities.

3.11.3 The incident management procedures (including those for product recall and withdrawal) shall 
be tested, at least annually, in a way that ensures their effective operation. Results of the test 
shall be retained and shall include timings of key activities. The results of the test and of any 
actual recall shall be used to review the procedure and implement improvements as necessary.

Interpretation Tests of the withdrawal and recall procedures

The incident management procedure must be tested at least annually. This test must include 
a test of the product withdrawal and recall processes which form part of the incident 
management procedure.

It should be emphasised that traceability is only part of this procedure and therefore a 
repeat test of the traceability will not, on its own, be sufficient to demonstrate that the site is 
meeting this requirement. The aims of testing the full procedure are to:

• demonstrate that the system works
• highlight any gaps and where the system requires improvement
• demonstrate how quickly the required information can be collated, and thereby corrective 

action taken, such as materials being isolated and quarantined
• act as a training exercise for personnel to ensure that clear roles and responsibilities are 

undertaken in the event of a real withdrawal situation.

The test of the recall and withdrawal procedure must include verification of the decision-
making process, traceability of raw materials through to finished product, verification of 
contacts, and timings of key activities.

Records must be kept of tests of the recall and withdrawal procedure and must include a 
review of the result of the test and any action taken for improvement.

If the site has had an actual withdrawal or recall which fully tested its recall procedures, then 
this would be a substitute for a recall test as long as records are maintained, an analysis of 
the effectiveness of the recall procedure is carried out, and any areas for improvement are 
identified and acted upon.

In larger businesses the recall team may involve head office personnel and the test may be 
run from the head office. In this case the links between the production site management and 
the head office recall team need to be clear.

Clause Requirements
3.11.4 In the event of a significant food safety, authenticity or legality incident, including a product 

recall, regulatory food safety non-conformity (e.g. a regulatory enforcement notice) or food 
safety-related withdrawal, the certification body issuing the current certificate for the site 
against this Standard shall be notified within 3 working days.

The company shall then provide sufficient information to enable the certification body to 
assess any effects of the incident on the ongoing validity of the current certificate within 21 
calendar days. As a minimum, this shall include corrective action, root cause analysis and a 
preventive action plan.

Interpretation Notification of recalls to the certification body

Where there is a significant incident related to product safety, authenticity or legality 
the site manufacturing or processing the implicated product is required to notify their 
certification body of the situation. The types of situation that should be notified include:

• all product recalls
• any situation where the regulatory authority insists on action (e.g. an enforcement notice) 

due to product safety or legality concerns
• legal proceedings with respect to product safety or legality
• adverse media attention relating to product safety
• any food safety incident with the potential to harm a consumer
• any food safety-related product withdrawal (it is worth noting that only product safety-

related withdrawals need to be notified to the certification body; other types of product 
withdrawal, such as those related to product quality, do not need to be notified).

The aim of this notification is to ensure that the integrity of the certificate is maintained by 
allowing the certification body to assess whether the incident affects the certification status 
of the site.

It is important that action is taken in a timely manner; therefore this initial notification, that 
a notifiable incident has occurred, must be completed within 3 working days of the recall or 
other action taking place.

The company must also provide sufficient information to enable the certification body 
to assess any effects of the incident on the ongoing validity of the current certificate. 
Therefore, as a minimum, the company must forward copies of its corrective action, root 
cause analysis and preventive action plan. Note that this additional information may 
take some time to collate and evaluate prior to communication to the certification body, 
especially in the case of a complex incident. Therefore, it is not expected that this will be 
available at the time of the initial notification, but may be submitted to the certification body 
at a later date. It must, however, be submitted within 21 days of the incident.

Where appropriate, the certification body can request further information or conduct a full 
or partial re-audit of the site to confirm certification.

4 Site standards

4.1 External standards and site security

The production site shall be of suitable size, location and construction, and be maintained to reduce the risk of 
contamination and facilitate the production of safe and legal finished products.

Interpretation

This part of the Standard is one of the most straightforward. It requires that the manufacturing facility is fit for 
purpose, both externally and internally, and that operations are conducted in an orderly fashion so as not to 
jeopardise the safety, legality or quality of the product.

This section also includes the security systems that must be in place to control access to both external and internal 
areas of the site, buildings and product, including the records of all visitors to the site.

Clause Requirements
4.1.1 Consideration shall be given to local activities and the site environment, which may have 

an adverse impact on finished product integrity, and measures shall be taken to prevent 
contamination. Where measures have been put into place to protect the site (from potential 
contaminants, flooding etc.), they shall be reviewed in response to any changes.

Interpretation Local activities and site environment

Local activities and the site environment must not have an adverse impact on finished 
product integrity. (A site plan or map that indicates neighbouring activities may be useful.) 
Points to consider may include:

• derelict buildings, rubbish dumps, wasteland, etc. which could harbour pests
• adjacent watercourses at risk of flooding
• neighbouring companies and the nature of their business (e.g. presenting air or odour taint 

potential).

Appropriate measures, such as additional pest or flood control, must be put in place and 
reviewed to ensure they are continually effective (e.g. by inclusion in internal audit schedules).

4.1.2 The external areas shall be maintained in good order. Where grassed or planted areas are 
located near buildings, they shall be regularly tended and well maintained. External traffic 
routes under site control shall be suitably surfaced and maintained in good repair to mitigate 
the risk of contamination of the product.

Interpretation Maintenance of external areas

External areas must be maintained in good order and the condition of the site included in 
audit procedures. Overgrown areas can harbour pests; therefore, where areas are planted, 
they must be tended regularly. For example, good practice is to have a 0.5 m clear zone 
between the bottom of vegetation and external walls.

Drainage in external areas is expected to deal with normal quantities of rainfall without 
long-term pooling of water. If natural drainage is inadequate, external drainage must be 
installed.

To prevent potential contamination by dust, mud etc. , all traffic routes under the control of 
the company must be suitably surfaced and maintained in good order. It is recognised that

Interpretation 
continued

traffic routes may have a variety of surfaces, and contamination risk to products will be 
influenced by other factors, such as weather conditions. The principle is to ensure that 
products are not placed at additional risk of contamination through the inappropriate 
surfacing of routes where products are transferred. Risk may also be reduced by a 
combination of procedures, such as the suitable protection of products while in transit, or 
wash-down of transit vessels prior to entering production areas.

4.1.3 The building fabric shall be maintained to minimise potential for product contamination (e.g. 
elimination of bird-roosting sites, sealing gaps around pipes to prevent pest entry, ingress of 
water and other contaminants).

Interpretation Maintenance of buildings

The outsides of buildings must be monitored and maintained in a condition such that they 
do not present a risk of product contamination. For example, pipework must be appropriately 
sealed to prevent pest entry, bird nesting sites must be eliminated (e.g. by using appropriate 
netting), and ingress of water and other contaminants must be prevented.

4.1.4 Policies and systems shall be in place to ensure that access to the site by staff, contractors 
and visitors is controlled. A visitor recording system shall be in place.

Contractors and visitors, including drivers, shall be made aware of the procedures for access 
to the site.

Only authorised personnel shall have access to production and storage areas. Contractors 
working in product processing or storage areas shall be the responsibility of a nominated 
person.

Staff shall be trained in site security procedures.

Interpretation Access to the site

There must be a visitor-reporting or monitoring procedure. When visitors or contractors 
come on site, they should not be able to enter production areas without first reporting to 
site representatives, who will:

• make them aware of site rules; for example, relating to access
• issue them with any protective clothing necessary for the areas they are visiting.

Good practice is to include details of the name, company, date, time of entry and exit, as well 
as the purpose of the visit.

Only authorised personnel should have access to production and storage areas. Therefore, 
these areas should have designated access points, which should be directly monitored or 
locked with, for example, keys issued to nominated personnel, key-code locks or alarmed.

Contractors or visitors working in these areas must be the responsibility of a nominated 
member of staff. It is normally good practice for them to be accompanied by the nominated 
staff while in production and storage areas.

All staff must be trained in the company security procedures and form part of the security 
arrangements. They should be encouraged to make enquiries on or report unknown persons 
in the facility. They must not compromise their personal safety; suspicious activities should 
always be referred to security staff (where they are available).

4.2 Food defence

Systems shall protect products, premises and brands from malicious actions while under the control of the site.

Interpretation

The objective is to ensure that the safety of finished products is not jeopardised through malicious actions, 
tampering or unauthorised persons.

The following clauses mirror those concerning food fraud (section 5.4), so the site can choose to consider food 
defence and food fraud together, if that is a more effective use of time and resource, or separately if the company 
prefers, providing both food authenticity and food defence are robustly assessed and managed.

Good practice, especially in larger companies, is to use a multi-disciplinary team that includes different roles within 
the company; for example, quality assurance, technical management, production, security and human resources. 
In smaller companies this may not be possible, but consideration should be given to the inclusion of all relevant 
colleagues or expertise.

In companies with multiple sites, some or all of the food defence threat assessment may be developed in one of two 
ways:

• centrally; for example, by a head office; or
• locally at each individual office.

Where it is completed centrally it is important to ensure that the assessment and resultant food defence plan 
remain relevant to the specific sites and their activities. This may be achieved by, for example:

• including members from the relevant sites in the food defence team
• ensuring that the study is reviewed by senior members of staff located at the relevant sites
• including the assessment and plan in the scope of the internal audit programme.

The BRCGS auditor will look for evidence of checks against local site activities and sign-off of the completeness and 
accuracy of the study.

BRCGS will publish additional guidance on food defence, which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed 
online at BRCGS Participate.

Clause Requirements
4.2.1 Where personnel are engaged in threat assessments and food defence plans, the individual 

or team responsible shall understand potential food defence risks at the site. This shall 
include knowledge of both the site and the principles of food defence.

Where there is a legal requirement for specific training, this shall be in place.

Interpretation Competency of the food defence team

It is important that personnel completing food defence threat assessments are competent 
to develop the plan; they need to understand the risks they are trying to prevent. Therefore, 
it is expected that within the team there will be knowledge of the principles of food defence 
and the site.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

The Standard is not prescriptive regarding how this knowledge is demonstrated and may 
include, for example:

• training (e.g. a training course in food defence)
• experience (e.g. demonstrable knowledge of the site such as security-related duties, or 

length of service at the site)
• other competency (e.g. the completeness and effectiveness of the threat assessment and 

its implementation).

Where there is a legal requirement for specific training, for example, in the US FSMA, the 
site is expected to be able to demonstrate that this has been appropriately completed.

In the event of the site not having the appropriate in-house knowledge, external expertise 
(e.g. food safety consultants) may be used; however, reference should be made to clause 
1.2.4 and section 3.5.3.

4.2.2 The company shall undertake a documented risk assessment (threat assessment) of the 
potential risks to products from any deliberate attempt to inflict contamination or damage. 
This threat assessment shall include both internal and external threats.

The output from this assessment shall be a documented food defence plan. This plan shall 
be kept under review to reflect changing circumstances and market intelligence. It shall be 
formally reviewed at least annually and whenever:

• a new risk emerges (e.g. a new threat is publicised or identified)
• an incident occurs where product security or food defence is implicated.

Where applicable, the food defence plan shall meet the legal requirements in the country of 
sale or intended use.

Interpretation Documented assessment of security

The company must undertake a threat assessment of the risks inherent to the operation 
to prevent malicious intervention. The threat assessment needs to consider both external 
threats (e.g. individuals or organisations gaining unauthorised access to the site, building or 
products) and internal threats, such as malicious tampering by staff who are authorised to be 
on site.

Each area (e.g. warehouses, processing areas and external storage areas) needs to be assessed 
in terms of how vulnerable the product is to contamination. Sensitive or restricted areas, 
such as open product areas, are likely to be the most vulnerable; the vulnerability of the 
packaged product will depend on the nature of the packaging. Details of IT systems and data 
protection should also be included in the assessment.

The output of the threat assessment must be a food defence plan, which details:

• the identified risks
• the mitigation strategy; i.e. the steps or mechanisms used to avoid or mitigate the 

identified risks (see clauses 4.2.3 and 4.2.4).

The food defence plan must be reviewed periodically; for example:

• when there is a change to the site or buildings
• when new market intelligence or supply chain information indicates a new or changed 

threat

• following an incident where product security or food defence systems are implicated. 
This may include all forms of incident, as well as any customer complaints indicating that 
current food defence measures are not effective

• at least annually.

Records of the review need to be available for the audit.

Where there are legal requirements relating to food defence (e.g. in the US FSMA), the site 
must be able to demonstrate that its food defence plan meets these requirements.

4.2.3 Where raw materials or products are identified as being at particular risk, the food defence 
plan shall include controls to mitigate these risks. Where prevention is not sufficient or 
possible, systems shall be in place to identify any tampering.

These controls shall be monitored, the results documented, and the controls reviewed at 
least annually.

Interpretation Additional controls to mitigate risks

The site’s food defence plan may result in the need to take additional measures to mitigate 
risks to raw materials or product. This may include extra verification or testing when raw 
materials are delivered, or additional wrapping with tamper evidence on pallets. Whatever 
the measure, it should be appropriate and validated to ensure that it is effective.

The auditor will expect to see the documented plan (clause 4.2.2) and the methodology of 
determining which products, materials or areas require additional control. The additional 
measures and procedures should be documented and the auditor will expect to see these 
measures in action at the time of the audit.

Ideally the controls used should prevent the threat from occurring; however, where this is 
not possible, the controls should mitigate risk and use tamper evidence so that malicious 
activity can be seen and addressed in a timely manner, before it becomes a product safety 
issue.

The systems must be reviewed at least annually, including the controls identified in the plan, 
to check whether they are still effective and relevant.

4.2.4 Areas where a significant risk is identified shall be defined in the food defence plan, 
monitored and controlled. These shall include external storage and intake points for 
products and raw materials (including packaging).

Staff shall be trained in food defence procedures.

Interpretation Authorised access

The basic principle is that only authorised staff should have access to production and 
storage areas. Levels of access for various areas at the site may differ between employees.

Restriction of access to areas where sensitive materials are stored (e.g. laboratories, 
maintenance areas or document storage areas) should also be in place. Where appropriate, 
areas should be locked when not in use.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

All staff must be trained in the company food defence procedures. This is not the same as 
the training described in clause 4.2.1. There, the staff involved in the threat assessment and 
development of the site’s food defence plan must have knowledge of the principles of food 
defence and the site, whereas this clause requires all staff to be trained in the relevant food 
defence procedures; i.e. in the relevant site procedures that have been developed as a result 
of the food defence threat assessment.

Where a site wishes to combine this training with the security training described in clause 
4.1.4, this is acceptable providing both topics are sufficiently covered.

4.3 Layout, product flow and segregation

Fundamental
The factory layout, flow of processes and movement of personnel shall be sufficient to prevent the 
risk of product contamination and to comply with relevant legislation.

Interpretation

The physical layout and flow of processes, materials and personnel must be identified, designed, managed and 
maintained to protect product integrity and prevent contamination, whether physical, chemical or microbiological.

Clause Requirements
4.3.1 The site shall assess the production risk zones required for the products manufactured, 

processed or packed at the site, using the definitions in Appendix 2 of the Standard.

Interpretation Production risk zones

All sites need to ensure that the production facilities are suitable for the types of products 
they are manufacturing, processing or packing. This includes an assessment of the 
production risk zones needed for the prevention of microbiological contamination.

Full details of the definitions of the production risk zones recognised by the Standard are 
given in Appendix 2 of the Standard. However, in summary, the Standard recognises six 
zones:

• high-risk and high-care zones for chilled or frozen and ready-to-eat products where there 
is a risk of contamination

• ambient high care for products where there is a risk of contamination with vegetative 
micro-organisms originating from raw materials and the products are stored in ambient 
conditions (rather than chilled or frozen)

• low-risk areas
• enclosed product areas (e.g. storage areas where products are fully enclosed within 

packaging and production areas where the product is fully enclosed within the equipment 
or pipework)

• non-product areas (i.e. areas such as offices, where products are not taken at any stage in 
their manufacture or storage).

It is important to note that the high-risk, high-care and ambient high-care production zones 
usually only apply to part of a factory’s production processes. These zones typically start 
when products exit a microbiological kill step and include all the processes and steps until 
the products are enclosed in packaging.

The auditor will expect to see a documented assessment comparing the products 
manufactured, processed or packed on site with the definitions within Appendix 2 of the 
Standard.

Where a site identifies the need for a high-risk, high-care or ambient high-care production 
zone, the relevant clauses from section 8 will apply to those areas.

4.3.2 There shall be a map of the site. At a minimum, this map shall define:

• production risk zones, where product is at different levels of risk from pathogen 
contamination – for example, high-risk, high-care, ambient high-care, low-risk and 
enclosed product areas (see clause 4.3.1 and Appendix 2)

• access points for personnel
• access points for raw materials (including packaging), semi-finished products and open 

products
• routes of movement for personnel
• routes of movement for raw materials (including packaging)
• routes for the removal of waste
• routes for the movement of rework
• location of any staff facilities, including changing rooms, toilets, canteens and smoking 

areas
• production process flows
• any areas where time segregation is used to complete different activities (for example, 

time segregation for high-care areas).

Interpretation Site map

The aim of the site map is to provide an overview of all the locations within the site, areas 
where the product is at different levels of risk from the general environment and the 
movements of products, materials and people. It can then be used to support the site’s risk 
assessments and subsequent prevention of contamination; for example, by identifying the 
locations where potential hazards (e.g. allergen cross-contamination) can occur.

The site map will be expected to illustrate the locations of critical facilities and activities, as 
detailed in the requirement, including:

• production risk zones (e.g. high-risk areas, high-care areas, low-risk areas, and enclosed 
product areas; see clause 4.3.1). The object of identifying the production risk zones is 
to ensure that the standards of environmental hygiene, particularly those concerning 
equipment, buildings, cleaning and personnel hygiene, are appropriate for the work being 
undertaken. It also allows the product and personnel flows to be reviewed, to ensure they 
do not compromise product safety

• access points for personnel clearly showing the routes into, and out of the site and 
production areas

• access points for raw materials, semi-finished products and open products
• routes of movement for personnel. If it is necessary to allow access through production 

areas, good practice is to identify designated walkways that ensure there is adequate 
separation from materials. Wherever possible, all facilities should be designed and 
positioned so that the movement of personnel is by simple, logical routes

• routes of movement for raw materials
• routes of movement for the removal of waste
• routes of movement for rework
• the location of staff facilities, including changing rooms, toilets, canteens and smoking 

areas
• areas where time segregation is used; in other words, where the same production area 

is used as both a high-care and a low-risk production zone at different times, with time 
segregation being used to separate the products with different risks (see Appendix 1 for 
definitions).

Sites which have identified the need for high-risk, high-care or ambient high-care areas (see 
clause 4.3.1) will also need to include the location of the pathogen control step(s) on the 
map (see clause 8.1.1).

The Standard is not prescriptive on the format of the map, providing all of the relevant 
information is available. For example:

• It is often useful to put the required information on several overlapping maps rather than a 
single diagram.

• In complex sites a schematic diagram may be of greater benefit than a map.

4.3.3 Contractors and visitors, including drivers, shall be made aware of the requirements 
of the areas they are visiting, with special reference to hazards and potential product 
contamination.

Interpretation Contractors and visitors

Contractors and visitors (including drivers) must be made aware of all access restrictions and 
procedures related to them. Visitors should be told when they sign in and the information 
should be specific to the areas they will be visiting.

Contractors who visit regularly should be trained to a similar level as employees, and a 
record of the training retained.

4.3.4 The movement of personnel, raw materials, packaging, rework and/or waste shall not 
compromise the safety of products. The process flow, together with the use of demonstrably 
effective procedures, shall be in place to minimise the risk of the contamination of raw 
materials, intermediate/semi-processed products, packaging and finished products.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Movement of personnel, raw materials, packaging, rework and waste

The HACCP or food safety plan must identify the potential risks associated with all 
production risk zones and the appropriate controls (including the level of prerequisite 
programmes) for the safe production of the products.

A combination of process flow and procedures (e.g. the prerequisite programme and 
work instructions) will be used to minimise risk to raw materials, packaging and products. 
Particular attention needs to be paid to the movement of personnel, raw materials, 
packaging, rework and waste, to ensure that the routes taken are defined and product safety 
is not compromised. For example, the removal of unnecessary packaging, such as debagging 
or removing outer boxes, should take place in a designated area, usually prior to transfer to 
production areas, in order to avoid potential foreign-body risks from discarded packaging.

The procedures developed to ensure product safety must be documented and validated as 
effective, and the appropriate staff must be trained. For example, where sites are receiving 
packaging through ‘hole in the wall’ operations, suitable controls should be in place to 
ensure that there is no risk to the product and the materials are treated appropriately. For 
example, an adjacent factory might deliver packaging materials on a conveyor or belt, as is 
often the case in dairy packing and carbonated beverages.

4.3.5 Premises shall allow sufficient working space and storage capacity to enable all operations 
to be carried out properly under safe hygienic conditions.

Interpretation Work and storage space

Premises must be designed to allow sufficient working space and storage capacity so that 
all operations are carried out properly under safe, hygienic conditions, thereby reducing 
the potential for cross-contamination between activities because of close proximity. For 
example, overfull refrigerated storage may lead to doors being left open for extended 
lengths of time because of difficulties in accessing required materials. This would lead to a 
non-conformity.

Consideration should be given to all activities, including inspection, cleaning, pest control 
and maintenance, as well as manufacturing operations.

4.3.6 Temporary structures constructed during building work or refurbishment etc. shall be 
designed and located to avoid pest harbourage and ensure the safety and quality of 
products.

Interpretation Temporary structures

Temporary structures (e.g. those constructed during building work or refurbishment) must 
be designed and located to avoid pest harbourage, unsanitary conditions and potential 
contamination of products. For example, where walls have to be knocked through during 
installation or expansion work, the integrity of the unit must be preserved to avoid pest 
entry, and scaffolding used in open product areas must be of the appropriate hygienic 
standard.

Risk assessment of temporary activities or structures should be completed prior to their 
introduction.

4.4 Building fabric, raw material-handling, preparation, processing, packing and storage 
areas

The fabrication of the site, buildings and facilities shall be suitable for the intended purpose.

Interpretation

The design, construction and maintenance of the interior of the facility must support effective cleaning and protect 
products from contamination.

The type of finish to walls, floors and ceilings must, at a minimum, meet the requirements laid down in any applicable 
legislation for the industry, and be suitable for the intended purpose.

Where a site has different production risk zones (see clause 4.3.1), good practice is to consider whether there are 
different facility requirements for each zone.

Clause Requirements
4.4.1 Walls shall be finished and maintained to prevent the accumulation of dirt, minimise 

condensation and mould growth, and facilitate cleaning.

Interpretation Walls

This clause refers to the condition of the internal surfaces of the walls (other aspects of the 
wall’s condition are covered separately in clause 4.1.3).

The walls in areas handling raw materials and preparing, processing, packing or storing 
product must be kept in a sound condition and must be easy to clean and, where necessary, 
to disinfect. For example, walls must have a smooth, impervious finish with sealed surfaces, 
be in a good state of repair and be free from flaking paint.

Tiling of walls is best avoided but, if present, must be in good condition, with no cracks or 
loose tiles. Ledges (e.g. from ducting or piping) should be kept to a minimum or designed to 
facilitate cleaning (e.g. with a slope to avoid dust collection).

Vulnerable wall surfaces or corners (e.g. where vehicles pass in close proximity) should 
be protected from damage (e.g. with properly sealed metal plating or barriers). Junctions 
(including ‘wall to floor’, ‘wall to ceiling’ and ‘wall to wall’) should be maintained in good 
condition to facilitate cleaning (e.g. by being appropriately sealed).

4.4.2 Floors shall be suitably hard-wearing to meet the demands of the process, and withstand 
cleaning materials and methods. They shall be impervious, be maintained in good repair and 
facilitate cleaning.

Interpretation Floors

The floors in areas handling raw materials and preparing, processing, packing or storing 
product must be kept in a sound condition and be easy to clean and, where necessary, 
to disinfect. Floors must be constructed of materials that are impervious, hard-wearing, 
repairable and resistant to chemical attack so that they can withstand appropriate cleaning 
procedures.

Clause Requirements
4.4.3 Drainage, where provided, shall be sited, designed and maintained to minimise risk of 

product contamination and not compromise product safety. Machinery and piping shall 
be arranged so that, wherever feasible, process waste water goes directly to drain. Where 
significant amounts of water are used, or direct piping to drain is not feasible, floors shall 
have adequate falls to cope with the flow of any water or effluent towards suitable drainage.

Interpretation Drainage

Drainage must be designed and maintained to ensure that product contamination risks are 
minimised. For example, drainage design might include methods to prevent flow back and 
pest ingress, and routeing of waste systems to prevent dripping on products, packaging or 
ingredients.

Due consideration must be given to drainage from any internal laboratories or other 
hazardous operations undertaken on site to ensure that blockages or the presence of micro-
organisms could not result in the contamination of processing areas.

Drainage systems must not constitute a potential risk to product (e.g. from potential leakage) 
when passing through or over production areas. Where feasible, the design of equipment 
must ensure that process waste water (e.g. condensate drainage from refrigeration or 
temperature-controlled areas, or sink waste water) goes directly to a drain to minimise 
contamination risk.

Where significant amounts of water are used (e.g. where wet cleaning is carried out) and 
direct piping to a drain is not possible, floors must have adequate falls to cope with the flow 
of effluent (i.e. pooling of water should not occur) as this constitutes a splash hazard and, 
therefore, a contamination risk.

Note that the additional requirements for drainage in high-risk and high-care areas are 
covered in section 8.2.

4.4.4 Ceilings and overheads shall be constructed, finished and maintained to prevent the risk of 
product contamination.

Interpretation Ceilings and overheads

Ceilings and overheads in areas handling raw materials and preparing, processing, packing 
or storing product must be appropriately designed and kept in a sound condition to avoid 
the risk of contamination to product. Prevention of the accumulation of dirt, minimising 
condensation and mould growth, and facilitating cleaning should all be considered.

In rooms with high ceilings that are difficult to clean or maintain, line covers over open 
product could reduce the risk of contamination.

4.4.5 Where suspended ceilings or roof voids are present, adequate access to the void shall be 
provided to facilitate inspection for pest activity, unless the void is fully sealed.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Suspended ceilings

Where suspended ceilings are used (or roof voids are present), access must be available 
for pest control purposes, even if this roof void is not normally used, unless it can be 
demonstrated that the void is entirely sealed.

Refrigeration equipment is often located in the roof void, and access will be required for 
maintenance.

4.4.6 Where elevated walkways, access steps or mezzanine floors are adjacent to or pass over 
production lines which have open products, they shall be:

• designed to prevent contamination of products and production lines
• easy to clean
• correctly maintained.

Interpretation Elevated walkways, access steps and mezzanine floors

Mezzanine floors, access steps and suspended or elevated walkways (for example, in 
production areas or over production lines) should be safeguarded to ensure they do not 
present a contamination risk to products below. This is particularly necessary where open 
products or open raw materials are handled and any contamination could have an immediate 
impact on the product (e.g. walkways over a production line where open products are 
processed).

Their design could include features such as solid treads (rather than perforated material), 
back plates and enclosed sides to prevent items from falling into the production area below, 
for example, from footwear.

The cleaning methods for these floors, steps and walkways should not allow waste materials 
or cleaning materials (e.g. wash water) to fall onto equipment or the production line below; 
for example, by using minimal amounts of water to reduce the likelihood of splashing or 
dripping onto materials below.

Sites should include any elevated walkways, access steps and mezzanine floors in the 
procedures concerning installation and maintenance activities with the express intention of 
ensuring that they (and their use) do not pose a hazard to the product both:

• when initially designed and installed, and
• during use (e.g. due to erosion or ‘wear and tear’).

For example, by including the mezzanine floor, access steps or elevated walkway in the 
programme of documented inspections of the factory environment (see clause 3.4.4), the 
site should be able to facilitate prompt corrective action in the event of any problems.

4.4.7 Where there is a risk to product, windows and roof glazing which are designed to be opened 
for ventilation purposes shall be adequately screened to prevent the ingress of pests.

Interpretation Use of windows for ventilation

Where there is a risk to product, such as in production or storage areas, windows and 
roof glazing that are designed to be opened for ventilation purposes must be adequately 
screened to prevent ingress of hazards such as pests or dust (e.g. by the use of mesh of an 
appropriate size to cover the windows).

Clause Requirements
4.4.8 Doors (both internal and external) shall be maintained in good condition. At a minimum:

• external doors and dock levellers shall be close fitting or adequately proofed
• external doors to open product areas shall not be opened during production periods 

except in emergencies
• where external doors to enclosed product areas are opened, suitable precautions shall be 

taken to prevent pest ingress.

Interpretation Doors

Doors and doorway equipment must be maintained in good condition, be easy to clean and 
kept clean, and provide an adequate level of pest proofing for the site. They should re-
establish continuous contact with the floor when lowered.

Doors through which vehicles (such as forklift trucks) travel should be inspected and door 
frames should be fitted with close-fitting metal plates for protection. External doors to open 
product areas where activities such as raw-material handling, preparation, processing and 
packing occur must not be opened during production, except in emergencies.

Where external doors to enclosed product areas are opened, suitable precautions must be 
taken to prevent pest ingress (e.g. strip curtains – see clause 4.4.11 for further details).

Sites should be aware that the doors themselves can be a source of physical contamination, 
particularly where they are designed to rise from floor contact to above the product as it 
is carried through (e.g. the potential for drip and therefore contamination of product as it 
passes through the doorway). It is not necessary to remove such doors, but sites should 
assess whether it is necessary to carry out mitigating steps, such as covering the product 
before it goes through the doorway.

Mechanical and electronic doors should be included in any planned or condition-based 
maintenance programmes (i.e. they should be maintained and repaired in a timely fashion).

4.4.9 Suitable and sufficient lighting shall be provided for correct operation of processes, 
inspection of product and effective cleaning.

Interpretation Lighting

Adequate lighting must be provided to allow:

• staff to be able to monitor quality and defects
• the correct operation of processes
• effective cleaning
• a safe working environment.

Note that some countries have specific legislation relating to minimal standards of lighting 
within the workplace. The site will need to be aware of these legislative requirements if it is 
located in a relevant country or region.

In the absence of specific legislation, industry guidelines state that preparation, processing 
and packing areas should generally be illuminated to a minimum intensity of 200 lux, with 
inspection areas requiring higher illumination such as 500 or 750 lux. All areas need to be 
considered; for example, poor lighting in storage areas may hinder effective cleaning or 
inspection.

Clause Requirements
4.4.10 Adequate ventilation and extraction shall be provided in product storage and processing 

environments to prevent condensation or excessive dust.

Interpretation Ventilation and extraction

Adequate ventilation and extraction must be provided, particularly in areas where very dusty 
operations are carried out (e.g. in dry-ingredient handling areas) or where there is potential 
for condensation build-up (e.g. in cooking areas).

Where air socks are used, the need for them to be cleaned and maintained should be 
considered. The frequency of this cleaning should be based on risk.

4.4.11 Where plastic strip curtains are present, these shall be maintained in good condition, clean, 
fitted correctly (e.g. to prevent pest ingress or for temperature control), and shall not pose a 
food safety risk.

Interpretation Strip curtains

Strip curtains are a common way of providing protection from hazards, or to facilitate 
environmental controls; for example, to:

• prevent ingress of pests or dirt (e.g. where there are external doors into production or 
storage areas)

• help regulate temperature, air pressure or air flow
• provide a hygiene barrier (i.e. preventing activities in one area from posing a risk to 

products or materials in neighbouring areas).

Where strip curtains are used, they must be controlled to ensure they achieve the intended 
purpose and do not pose a food safety risk. For example, they must be:

• well fitting (usually defined as ‘as close to the floor as possible’, with no missing strips or 
gaps)

• repaired or replaced in a timely manner when damage does occur (while slight scratches 
are unlikely to pose a food safety risk and therefore may not require immediate action, 
missing strips or gaps caused by damage may allow pest ingress or contamination and will 
require timely action)

• in use whenever relevant site activities are occurring, and not tied back when they should 
be operational

• kept clean (to ensure they are not a source of product or raw material contamination; for 
example, to prevent microbiological, physical, chemical or allergen contamination). Ideally, 
strip curtains will be designed to be easy to clean.

Good practice is to include strip curtains in the inspection and maintenance programmes 
(see clauses 3.4.4 and 4.7.1) to facilitate timely identification of any concerns and the timely 
implementation of corrective action.

4.5 Utilities – water, ice, air and other gases

Utilities used within the production and storage areas shall be monitored to effectively control the risk of 
product contamination.

Interpretation

The utilities included within this requirement are specifically water, steam, ice, air and other gases that need to be 
controlled to ensure they do not constitute a contamination risk to product. Other commonly considered utilities, 
such as electricity, natural gas or fuel, are not included within these requirements.

Clause Requirements
4.5.1 All water (including ice and steam) used as a raw material in the manufacture of processed 

food, the preparation of product, hand-washing or equipment or plant cleaning shall be 
supplied in sufficient quantity, be potable at point of use, be fit for purpose and pose no risk 
of contamination according to applicable legislation.

Where water is stored and handled on site (e.g. in storage or holding tanks), these shall be 
managed to minimise food safety risks.

The microbiological and chemical quality of water shall be analysed as required by 
legislation or at least annually. The sampling points, scope of the test and frequency of 
analysis shall be based on risk, taking into account the source of the water, on-site storage 
and distribution facilities, previous sample history and usage.

Interpretation Water supply

Water used must be provided in sufficient quantities (e.g. for cleaning operations), pose 
no contamination risk (e.g. be potable), be fit for the intended purpose and conform to 
relevant legislation by being suitably treated or drawn from mains supply. Where required 
by legislation, private water supplies and treatment plants should be approved by local or 
national authorities.

The frequency of water analysis must be based on risk, including:

• legislative requirements for testing
• historical information
• the source of the water (e.g. mains supply or bore-hole)
• specific site concerns (e.g. duration of water storage or the use of lead pipes)
• treatments given to the water
• its usage.

The water is expected to comply with national legislation (e.g. EU directive 98/83/EC and its 
subsequent amendments) or, in the absence of this, with World Health Organization (WHO) 
standards for drinking water. The scope of testing completed by the site should be based on 
risk; for example:

• if the site has lead pipes, then tests should include the presence and concentration of lead
• if historical or published information indicates that the supply in the region has high levels 

of nitrate, then tests should incorporate this information.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

Water quality tests must be completed at least annually and be based on a risk assessment. 
If the water is supplied by a water supply company, a chemical analysis from the water 
company will suffice for the chemical requirements, unless there are other risks identified 
in the delivery system (e.g. lead pipes). Alternatively, testing should be carried out at the 
site to ensure that the water is tested and approved at the point of use. Where water is 
extracted from bore-holes and/or sites have on-site treatment facilities, additional checks 
will be required to ensure that the water is not contaminated either at the bore-hole or 
during treatment and that the treatment remains effective. The water should be sampled 
at appropriate points of use and this should be documented in a sampling plan (see clause 
4.5.2).

Where water is stored and handled on site (e.g. in storage or holding tanks), the site must 
assess any additional controls or testing needed to maintain food safety; for example, any 
limitation on the maximum storage time, operational controls to prevent microbiological 
contamination, or any monitoring of the condition of the tanks themselves (e.g. to ensure 
corrosion cannot become a source of product contamination).

Where ice or steam is used in production or is in contact with food, it must be produced 
from potable water or pose no risk of contamination according to applicable legislation, 
and must be included within the sampling plan. Where legislation specifically allows the 
use of non-potable water (e.g. in the washing of raw fish or livestock), the water must meet 
all legislative requirements for that process. The site will also need to have established 
through the HACCP process that the water does not present a risk to the final products 
(e.g. by introduction of chemical contaminants) or to other products within the processing 
environment.

4.5.2 An up-to-date schematic diagram shall be available of the water distribution system on site, 
including water source, holding tanks, water treatment and water recycling as appropriate. 
The diagram shall be used as a basis for water sampling and the management of water 
quality.

Interpretation Water distribution

The aim of this requirement is to identify the key components of the water distribution 
system and how the components interconnect, particularly where potable and non-
potable water are present. A fully detailed architect’s diagram showing the complete 
pipework system is not required; a general plan, map or schematic diagram is sufficient. 
The plan should enable the site management and auditor to assess potential hazards in the 
distribution system and ensure that adequate management systems are in place to negate 
the hazards. For example, water-holding tanks may present a microbiological hazard if not 
covered; water pooling may occur if the water flow is not controlled; and where water is 
recycled (e.g. for can cooling), the water may need to be treated and sometimes filtered to 
ensure a satisfactory water quality.

The source of the water shall be included in the diagram (e.g. a bore-hole, an on-site 
reservoir or the mains supply), along with any on-site water-treatment processes. The best 
water sampling points to assess the quality of water should be deduced from this plan.

4.5.3 Air and other gases used as an ingredient or that are in direct contact with products shall be 
monitored to ensure this does not represent a contamination risk. Compressed air that is in 
direct contact with the product shall be filtered at point of use.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Monitoring of gases and steam

Compressed air, steam or gases used as an ingredient or directly in contact with food 
must be monitored to ensure they do not contaminate the product. The main risks to 
consider are: the carry-over of boiler water-treatment chemicals in steam; dust particles in 
compressed air; and oil used as a lubricant in compressed-air systems.

The level of monitoring needs to be based on an assessment of potential risk. Steam 
generated from potable water free from additives, for instance, is not likely to present a risk.

Compressed air in direct contact with products needs to be filtered prior to use, and the 
filters checked and maintained to ensure they remain effective. The gauge of filtration (e.g. 
mesh size) and frequency of checks should be documented and based on risk assessment, 
taking into account the source of the air, the type of compressors used and the condition 
of the pipework (e.g. evidence of corrosion). The compressor suppliers or experts should 
be consulted to establish any potential risks and any necessary testing. The objective of 
using filters is to prevent dust particles and lubricating oil from the compression system 
contaminating the products. Therefore a single central filter, in close proximity to the 
compressor, but remote from the food-related use of the compressed air, is unlikely to 
provide sufficient product protection. The site must be able to justify the effectiveness of 
the filtration system employed.

If gases are used, such as in modified atmosphere packing, they must be demonstrated 
as being of an appropriate quality. Usually such gases are supplied in a compressed 
form in metal cylinders and the supplier management process (approved suppliers and 
specifications, with certificates of conformance if required) would be sufficient. In these 
circumstances, the site would not be expected to undertake its own checks. Compressed 
gases are generally considered to be microbiologically safe and the Standard does not 
require routine testing of such gases unless a specific risk has been identified.

There may be additional risks where gases are produced on site and these would need to 
be evaluated through a risk assessment. Additional information can be obtained from the 
British Compressed Air Society and the European Industrial Gases Association.

4.6 Equipment

All production and product-handling equipment shall be suitable for the intended purpose and shall be used to 
minimise the risk of contamination of product.

Interpretation

‘Suitability of equipment for its intended purpose’ includes the condition of the equipment, so that it does not pose a 
product contamination hazard; its ability to be effectively cleaned; and its capability of producing safe food products.

The site will need to consider the requirements:

• when purchasing new equipment or equipment that is new to the site (for example, second-hand or reconditioned 
equipment)

• when hiring equipment for a designated period
• where equipment is stored (storage conditions must ensure the safety and integrity of the equipment so that it 

cannot become a source of contamination; for example, equipment should be stored clean and in such a way that 
it does not harbour pests)

• when designing equipment that will be built by the company, e.g. by on-site engineers.

Movable equipment needs to be controlled to ensure that it cannot be a source of product contamination; for 
example, by restricting its use to designated areas, or using documented procedures to prevent contamination when 
moving it between areas.

Risk assessments and resultant controls must be proportionate to the likely risk to the product; for example, 
the equipment’s proximity to product (e.g. use in production areas or open product areas), its significance to the 
production process, and its complexity (for example, a new production line or part of a production line will need 
significantly more consideration than a small item such as a plastic scoop).

There are a number of clauses within the Standard that may need to be considered in conjunction with this section; 
for example:

• Equipment maintenance and condition monitoring is covered in section 4.7.
• New equipment that includes measuring devices should be calibrated according to the requirements in section 

6.4.
• Risks associated with new products or new production processes are covered in section 5.1; this will include the 

equipment associated with these new products and production processes.

There are a number of standards and industry guidelines that provide detailed recommendations for equipment; for 
example:

• EN 1672-2:2009 – Food Processing Machinery – Basic Concepts – Hygiene and Cleanability Requirements
• ISO 14159:2002 – Safety of Machinery — Hygiene Requirements for the Design of Machinery
• GFSI Benchmark JI (for building and equipment manufacturers) and JII (for building and equipment users).

Sites will need to ensure any applicable legislative requirements (for example, in the EU, the Machinery Directive 
2006/42/EC) are met.

Clause Requirements
4.6.1 There shall be a documented purchase specification for any new equipment detailing the 

site requirements for the equipment. This may, for example, include:

• any relevant legislation
• where applicable, requirements for food contact surfaces to meet legal requirements
• details of intended use of the equipment and the type of materials it will be handling.

Depending on its intended use, new equipment to site (including second-hand equipment) 
may require authorisation from a multi-disciplinary team.

The supplier should provide evidence that equipment meets these site requirements prior 
to supply.

Interpretation Equipment purchase specifications

The process for the purchase of new equipment must start prior to the actual purchase 
of the equipment, with an equipment purchase specification (sometimes referred to as 
user requirements). The aim of the clause is not to introduce onerous documentation for 
all equipment, but to ensure that new equipment meets the site’s needs; for example, it 
is suitable for its intended use and is designed to eliminate or manage any identified food 
safety hazards.

Interpretation 
continued

For the purposes of the Standard, new equipment can be defined as equipment bought 
directly from a manufacturer, second-hand equipment bought by the site (therefore new to 
the site) or equipment that has been refurbished externally. It does not include small parts 
such as screws or other non-food contact fixings.

Purchase specifications need to contain sufficient information to ensure product safety 
and suitability of the equipment. This means that the actual amount of detail in the 
purchase specification will be dependent on the type of equipment being purchased. For 
example, a simple plastic scoop is only likely to need a very simple set of user requirements, 
with minimal food hazards identified, whereas a new production line is likely to require 
significantly more details regarding, for example, product types, production rates and food 
contact requirements.

Purchase specifications usually include:

• reference to any relevant legislation
• requirements for food contact surfaces (i.e. where product will be in contact with the 

equipment)
• intended use of the equipment
• types of materials that will be used (this is particularly important for food contact surfaces, 

since potential migration from equipment may be affected by the composition of the food 
material, e.g. high fat or acidic materials can increase potential for migration).

Good practice is to consider who within the company can authorise the purchase of 
new equipment. For re-purchases of simple equipment, this may be simply a case of 
identifying who is authorised to order the product; however, for complex machinery (such 
as a new production line), there may need to be input from multiple departments, such as 
engineering, technical, hygiene and finance. This is to ensure that all critical food safety 
requirements have been considered and included within the specification.

Note that where equipment is purchased from suppliers in other regions or countries, 
legislative requirements may vary, and additional communication of requirements may 
facilitate the purchasing process.

The site should retain evidence of the specification developed, and evidence provided from 
the supplier demonstrating that the equipment meets these requirements, as this provides 
evidence of due diligence in the event of a challenge or incident.

During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will expect to see evidence of the purchase 
specification for any new equipment, the specification’s suitability for the specific 
equipment, equipment purchase matching the specification, and, as detailed in clauses 
4.6.2–4.6.7, commissioning of equipment, hygiene requirements, routine maintenance, etc.

Note that the clause relates to the purchase of new equipment. It does not require a site 
to retrospectively develop specifications for equipment that was purchased prior to the 
publication of the Standard, or prior to its decision to become certificated for the first time.

4.6.2 The design and construction of equipment shall be based on risk, to prevent product 
contamination. For example, the use of the correct seals, impervious surfaces or smooth 
welds and joints, where they are exposed to product and could otherwise result in foreign-
body, microbiological or allergen contamination of the product.

Equipment that is in direct contact with food shall be suitable for food contact and meet 
legal requirements where applicable.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Equipment in direct contact with food

The aim of this requirement is to ensure that equipment is not a source of product 
contamination, and that it complies with relevant food contact legislation where such 
legislation exists (for example, in the EU, the Food Contact Materials – Regulation (EC) 
1935/2004 and its subsequent amendments).

The clause provides some examples of potential issues, including:

• Food contact surfaces should be smooth and impervious; for example, to prevent 
accumulation of material that could lead to microbiological or allergen contamination of 
the product.

• Welds and joints should form a flat surface (again to prevent microbiological or allergen 
contamination).

Other well-documented issues have included the purchase of equipment (especially plastic 
items) not designed for food use leading to the migration of chemicals into food products.

The company must consider the risks associated with the equipment (including any risks 
associated with its design, construction and installation) and ensure that significant risks 
have been controlled. This can, for example, be achieved by use of a hygienic design risk 
assessment, which uses hygienic design principles to consider the risks of foreign-body, 
microbiological, allergen or chemical contamination of the product.

Before using the equipment, the company will need to have evidence that the risks have 
been considered, and of the suitability of the equipment, and must confirm its acceptability 
for food contact surfaces. For new equipment, this will usually form part of the purchase 
specification process (see clause 4.6.1). Where such evidence is not available (for example, 
when purchasing second-hand equipment) and the contact material is not a recognised 
food-safe material (such as certain grades of stainless steel), an additional assessment should 
be carried out to ensure safe use and to prevent food safety risks. The risk assessment 
should consider factors such as:

• the nature of the food contact surface and its known characteristics
• the length of contact time with the food
• the nature of the food and its potential for contamination (e.g. fatty or acidic foods are 

often at increased risk from migration of contaminants from plastic materials).

During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will not inspect every seal, bolt or food contact surface, 
but will:

• need to understand the site processes; for example, they may review the documented 
process and their suitability, whether they have been used in practice, and the 
completeness of relevant records

• inspect a small number of relevant examples of equipment where there is a food safety 
or quality implication; this may, for example, be completed during the inspection of 
equipment hygiene (see clause 4.11.1).

Clause Requirements
4.6.3 A documented, risk-based commissioning procedure shall be in place to ensure that food 

safety and integrity is maintained during the installation of new equipment to site.

Installation work shall be followed by a documented hygiene clearance procedure.

New equipment to site shall be inspected by an authorised member of staff before being 
accepted into operation.

The commissioning procedure shall include the update of any other site procedures that 
are affected by the new equipment, for example, training, operating procedures, cleaning, 
environmental monitoring, maintenance schedules or internal audits.

The design and placement of equipment shall ensure that it can be effectively cleaned and 
maintained.

Interpretation Equipment design and construction

The aim of this clause is to ensure there is a formal process for the introduction of 
equipment that is new to the site (see the interpretation for the statement of intent for this 
section), which ensures that product safety and integrity is maintained, when the equipment 
is introduced into and used within the production and storage areas.

The hazards associated with any specific item of equipment will vary considerably 
dependent on the nature of the equipment and its intended use. Using the previous 
example, a new plastic scoop is likely to require minimal commissioning, whereas a 
completely new production line is likely to require an extensive commissioning process.

Therefore the commissioning procedure should be risk-based, allowing the site the 
flexibility to complete the appropriate activities for the specific equipment. Examples of 
commissioning activity might include installation and sign-off of equipment, trials operating 
the equipment, cleaning validation and maintenance checks.

In order to facilitate routine cleaning, operation, inspection and servicing, equipment 
must be appropriately positioned (e.g. access provided under, inside and around it). Where 
equipment is permanently sited, it should be properly secured and sealed to the floor to 
prevent the accumulation of food debris underneath, where it cannot be cleaned. It has been 
well documented that, where equipment or fixtures allow organic matter and/or pathogens 
to collect and survive, this can subsequently cause product contamination as pathogens 
such as Salmonella or Listeria can survive for prolonged periods in these conditions if left 
undisturbed.

The site must ensure that the safety and integrity of product is not jeopardised during 
installation (e.g. equipment is not contaminated either by products used during installation 
such as sealants, nuts and bolts; by lubricants; or by packaging that has been removed 
from the equipment). Good practice is to schedule installation of larger or more complex 
equipment outside production hours. Where this is not practicable, suitable precautions 
must be taken to prevent contamination of products; for example, the use of screening to 
protect adjacent production lines.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

Following installation, equipment must be cleaned and inspected prior to use. An authorised 
member of staff (e.g. the production manager) is required to formally accept equipment into 
operation following this inspection, to confirm that all relevant installation, commissioning 
and cleaning activities have been completed satisfactorily. Records need to be maintained 
(e.g. signing the appropriate engineering record or line start-up check sheet) to demonstrate 
that the equipment has been inspected and is acceptable for use.

The commissioning procedure must include the updating of any other relevant site 
procedures that are affected by the new equipment; for example, training, operating 
procedures, cleaning, environmental monitoring, maintenance schedules or internal audits. 
This is to ensure that all staff have access to the relevant procedures and understand how to 
complete their activities correctly.

Note that the auditor will not stop equipment operating or the production flow in order to 
inspect equipment.

4.6.4 A procedure shall be in place to manage the movement of static equipment in production 
areas, to ensure that food safety is managed and the integrity of the equipment is 
maintained.

Interpretation Movement and repositioning of static equipment

Static equipment is defined as pieces of equipment that are not ordinarily moved or are 
moved only in exceptional circumstances; for example, due to redesign of the production 
area, relocation to another site or necessary maintenance that cannot be completed in situ.

There must be a documented procedure which covers how food safety and equipment 
integrity will be maintained during movement of the equipment.

Good practice is to complete a risk assessment to determine the specific risks and controls 
needed.

The procedure may include:

• the type of equipment to be moved
• how the movement will occur (e.g. whether specialist equipment or contractors are 

required)
• requirements for re-installation
• authorisation (which staff are authorised to permit movement)
• responsibility (which staff will be responsible for managing the movement)
• staff training (e.g. on the procedure to ensure they understand the risks involved)
• records required to demonstrate all necessary controls were completed
• post-movement cleaning (see, for example, clause 4.7.4).

4.6.5 Equipment that is not used or is taken out of service shall be cleaned and stored in a manner 
that does not pose a risk to the product.

Equipment stored in internal production and storage areas shall be kept clean.

Food contact equipment that has been stored but is not in daily use shall be cleaned and, 
where necessary, disinfected prior to use.

Interpretation Storage of equipment

Appropriate precautions must be put in place to prevent product contamination resulting 
from storage of equipment; for example, dirt or dust accumulation, harbourage of micro-
organisms, and potential pest activity if the equipment has not been fully cleaned before 
being stored.

Where equipment is stored within production or storage areas, it must be kept in a clean and 
hygienic condition (see clause 4.11.1). This might, for example, include:

• a documented cleaning procedure (see clause 4.11.2)
• periodic inspections, checks or condition monitoring (see clause 3.4.4)
• labelling to indicate that the equipment cannot be used without cleaning or sign-off
• management through the food safety plan or HACCP (e.g. clause 5.1.2).

Where equipment is intended for food contact, the equipment must be cleaned and, where 
necessary, disinfected prior to next use. It is good practice to inspect the equipment once 
out of storage to ensure it is fit for purpose.

4.6.6 Mobile equipment (e.g. forklift trucks, pallet trucks, scissor lifts and ladders) used in open 
product areas shall not pose a risk to the product.

Where the use of mobile equipment in external areas cannot be avoided and poses a risk to 
the product, the equipment shall be cleaned and disinfected prior to entering production 
areas.

Interpretation Mobile equipment

The aim of this requirement is to ensure that mobile equipment does not pose a risk to the 
product, including, for example, microbiological, allergen, chemical or foreign-body risks.

The site will therefore need defined procedures to ensure that any mobile equipment used 
in open product areas is used in such a way as to maintain product safety. This could, for 
example, include:

• a log of all mobile equipment
• approved users and training for users
• dedicated equipment: only used in designated open product areas
• condition monitoring, to ensure items remain suitable for use in an open product area
• cleaning and maintenance schedules.

Where the use of equipment in external areas cannot be avoided, and there is a risk of 
product contamination, additional procedures are required to ensure this risk is minimised. 
These may include:

• completing a risk assessment to identify areas/products where there is a risk of product 
contamination (the Standard does not require cleaning and disinfection of every piece 
of equipment every time it is used in an external area, but that the site should identify 
when there will be a risk to product, and ensure that appropriate cleaning is completed to 
prevent this risk)



FOOD SAFETY

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

• defining where equipment can be used
• specific cleaning and disinfection procedures prior to re-entry into production areas 

where a product contamination risk exists. In addition to explaining how the cleaning will 
be completed, it may be useful to identify the parts of the equipment that need to be 
cleaned (for example, tyres, wheels and the underbody may be a greater risk than other 
areas of the equipment).

Note that where a site operates multiple production risk zones (see Appendix 2 of 
the Standard), the additional requirements in section 8 of the Standard relating to the 
movement of equipment between production risk zones will also need to be considered.

4.6.7 Battery-charging equipment shall not be stored in open product areas (unless the batteries 
are fully sealed and/or maintenance-free) or where there is a risk to products.

Interpretation Battery-charging equipment

Mobile equipment may require battery-charging equipment. Where required, the battery-
charging equipment must not be stored or used in an open product area, unless the batteries 
are fully sealed and maintenance-free, to prevent the risk of chemical contamination of food 
products due to battery leakages or gases being emitted.

Good practice is to identify locations where battery-charging is permitted.

4.7 Maintenance

An effective maintenance programme shall be in operation for plant and equipment, to prevent contamination 
and reduce the potential for breakdowns.

Interpretation

To ensure that all equipment (including fixtures, fittings, cleaning tools and utensils), is suitably maintained and does 
not pose a product contamination risk (for example, due to foreign bodies created by the equipment), it must be 
controlled by a documented and effective maintenance system.

Planned maintenance may be completed internally or via contracted services. Maintenance undertaken internally 
must be documented (e.g. in the form of a plan or schedule) and records of the maintenance activity kept. For 
equipment that is maintained under external contracts, evidence of contractual agreements must be available.

Clause Requirements
4.7.1 There shall be a planned preventive maintenance schedule or condition monitoring system 

which includes all plant, processing equipment and mobile equipment. The maintenance 
requirements shall be defined when commissioning new equipment and reviewed after 
repairing existing equipment.

Interpretation Documented maintenance schedule

All plant, processing equipment and mobile equipment must be included in a planned 
preventive maintenance schedule or condition monitoring system.

Planned preventive maintenance is simply a schedule of proactive maintenance or servicing 
designed to prevent product contamination and reduce the potential for breakdowns. 
The identified maintenance tasks are completed at defined frequencies based on a risk 
assessment. This can be supported by condition monitoring where equipment is inspected 
at a set frequency for problems. The aim is to identify and correct any problem before 
product contamination or equipment breakdown occurs.

The frequency of preventive maintenance or condition monitoring should be based on 
risk assessment; for example, considering the likelihood of occurrence of a problem (e.g. 
previous occurrences of the problem or equipment manufacturer’s recommendations) 
and the likely risk of product contamination if the equipment fails (e.g. proximity to open 
product).

Activities should be documented, and appropriate corrective action taken where issues are 
highlighted.

Maintenance and condition monitoring requirements must be:

• established as part of the commissioning process for new equipment
• reviewed after repairs to equipment, to ensure that current monitoring and preventive 

maintenance activities remain appropriate.

4.7.2 In addition to any planned maintenance programme, where there is a risk of product 
contamination by foreign bodies arising from equipment damage, the equipment shall be 
inspected at predetermined intervals, the inspection results documented and appropriate 
action taken.

Interpretation Equipment inspection

Where there is a risk of foreign bodies contaminating product – for example, due to wear, 
erosion, loose or missing parts, or damage to equipment or pieces of machinery (e.g. sieves, 
mills, equipment covers) – there must be a periodic check of the equipment.

A documented check procedure must be carried out at defined intervals (e.g. at process 
start-up, at start of shift, during product changeover, and after cleaning or maintenance).

Inspection results must be documented and, where appropriate, action taken.

4.7.3 Where temporary repairs are made, these shall be documented and controlled to ensure 
that the safety or legality of products is not jeopardised. These temporary measures shall be 
permanently repaired as soon as practicable and within a defined timescale.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

142   brcgs.com

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Temporary repairs

Temporary repairs must be suitable, kept to a minimum and used only in an emergency. They 
must be controlled (i.e. documented and notified to a shift leader) to ensure that the safety 
or legality of product is not jeopardised, and a system must be in place to demonstrate that 
a permanent repair (or replacement of the equipment) is planned within a defined timescale 
(e.g. a works order).

The Standard is not prescriptive regarding the timescales for permanent repairs, as what 
is practicable will vary from site to site and according to the nature of the repair and any 
associated product safety risks. Typically, a full permanent repair is expected as soon as 
a replacement piece is available, or as soon as the line can be shut down. In all cases, the 
expectation is that the safety and legality of the product will be maintained in the interim.

In an organisation with a strong food safety culture, production staff should be 
knowledgeable about food safety, be empowered and feel ownership of compliance with the 
Standard, so that they feel confident about informing the relevant individual or department 
when a repair or adjustment needs to be made.

4.7.4 The site shall ensure that the safety or legality of products is not jeopardised during 
maintenance and subsequent cleaning operations. Maintenance work shall be followed by a 
documented hygiene clearance procedure.

Equipment and machinery shall be inspected by an authorised member of staff to confirm 
the removal of contamination hazards, before being accepted back into operation.

Interpretation Post-maintenance cleaning

The site must ensure that the safety and legality of product is not jeopardised during 
maintenance and cleaning operations. There are a number of ways that products can be 
contaminated during maintenance activities; for example, by:

• products or materials used during maintenance, such as sealants, nuts and bolts that are 
either not used correctly or not removed from the line after maintenance (for example, 
spare bolts, containers of lubricant, etc. need to be removed from the area when 
maintenance is complete)

• machinery parts that have broken or disintegrated and have not been adequately removed
• maintenance tools that have not been stored in a suitably clean condition.

Good practice is to schedule maintenance work outside production hours. Where this is 
not practical, suitable precautions must be taken to prevent the contamination of products; 
for example, by removing the item to be maintained from the production area, or by using 
suitable screening to protect both the production line and any adjacent equipment or 
production lines.

A procedure must be in place to ensure that, following maintenance work, equipment is 
cleaned and inspected prior to use. An authorised member of staff (e.g. the production 
manager) is required to formally accept equipment back into operation following this 
inspection to confirm that maintenance and associated cleaning have been completed 
satisfactorily. Records need to be maintained (e.g. by signing the appropriate engineering 
record or line start-up check sheet) to demonstrate that the equipment has been inspected 
and is acceptable for use.

4.7.5 Materials and parts used for equipment and plant maintenance shall be of an appropriate 

grade or quality.

Those materials (such as lubricating oil) that pose a risk by direct or indirect contact with raw 
materials (including primary packaging), intermediate products and finished products shall be 
food grade and of a known allergen status.

Interpretation Use of food-grade materials

Materials used for equipment and plant maintenance that pose a risk of direct or indirect 
contact with raw material, intermediates or final product must be of food grade and the 
presence of any allergens must be known and managed accordingly. Documentary evidence 
of the food-grade status must be held (for example, in a declaration by the supplier, on 
product data sheets or by demonstrable compliance to a recognised standard such as 
ISO 21469 for lubricants, or the US Code of Federal Regulations, e.g. 21 CFR 178.3570).

4.7.6 Engineering workshops shall be kept clean and tidy, and controls shall be in place to prevent 
transfer of engineering debris to production or storage areas.

Interpretation Engineering workshops

The engineering workshop must be controlled to minimise the potential for contamination 
of product. Consideration should be given to location and design, as well as procedures 
for control. For example, where it is not possible to avoid having an entrance directly from 
the engineering workshop to the production area, procedures must be in place to avoid 
contamination risks (e.g. by debris being carried inadvertently into the production or storage 
areas). These procedures may include changes of footwear and protective clothing, or matting 
specifically designed to collect any small pieces of debris from footwear (e.g. swarf mats).

Workshops need to be kept clean and tidy, operated in a controlled manner, and included 
in the housekeeping and cleaning procedures. The provision and location of hand-washing 
facilities for engineers entering the factory should be considered.

4.8 Staff facilities

Staff facilities shall be sufficient to accommodate the required number of personnel, and shall be designed and 
operated to minimise the risk of product contamination. The facilities shall be maintained in good and clean 
condition.

Interpretation

This section focuses on staff facilities from the perspective of eliminating product contamination.

Appropriate staff facilities must be provided to enable staff to adhere to company policies (e.g. the correct storage 
of protective clothing and personal belongings) to ensure the risk of product contamination is kept to a minimum. 
This must include adequate facilities to accommodate staff fluctuations, such as high production times, seasonal 
variations or the use of agency staff.

Washing, changing and toilet facilities provided for visitors and contractors must be of a standard that allows non-
staff members to meet suitable levels of hygiene. Best practice is that visitors and contractors follow exactly the 
same changing routine as staff (e.g. change in changing areas and not in management offices).

Clause Requirements
4.8.1 Designated changing facilities shall be provided for all personnel, whether staff, visitor or 

contractor. These shall be sited to allow direct access to the production, packing or storage 
areas without recourse to any external area. Where this is not possible, a risk assessment 
shall be carried out and procedures implemented accordingly (e.g. the provision of cleaning 
facilities for footwear).

Interpretation Changing facilities

Designated changing facilities must be provided for all staff (including visitors and 
contractors). The location and position of facilities is an important consideration, and this 
must be the subject of a risk assessment to ensure the protection of protective clothing 
from contamination before entering the production areas.

The size of the facilities needs to be adequate for the number of staff working at the factory 
and at times of peak staff numbers (e.g. at the start and end of shifts or when there are 
seasonal fluctuations).

Where changing facilities cannot be located with direct access to the production, packing or 
storage areas without recourse to an external area, a risk assessment must be used to identify 
where additional procedures need to be implemented (e.g. providing cleaning facilities for 
footwear where footwear is worn outside, or the donning of additional protective clothing 
on entry to production areas).

4.8.2 Storage facilities of sufficient size to accommodate personal items shall be provided for all 
personnel who work in raw material-handling, preparation, processing, packing and storage 
areas.

Interpretation Storage of personal items

To prevent staff from bringing personal items (e.g. keys, mobile phones or coins) into 
production and storage areas where they could contaminate products (e.g. as foreign bodies), 
there must be sufficient and suitably secure storage for employees’ belongings. Storage 
for bulky items such as motorbike leathers and helmets should be provided, as well as for 
smaller items such as jewellery and food.

Storage areas should be designed to facilitate good practice and cleaning (e.g. lockers with 
sloping tops to prevent the accumulation of rubbish and raised off the floor to facilitate 
cleaning).

4.8.3 Outdoor clothing and other personal items shall be stored separately from production 
clothing within the changing facilities. Facilities shall be available to separate clean and dirty 
production clothing.

Interpretation Segregation of personal items from work clothing

Separate storage facilities for personal items and work clothing are necessary to prevent 
cross-contamination of clothing via the locker. This can be achieved by:

• using a locker with a divider to separate work clothing from personal clothing
• enclosing protective clothing in a bag, such as a laundry bag, before use
• providing a separate area for the hanging of work clothing.

4.8.4 Suitable and sufficient hand-washing facilities shall be provided at access to, and at other 
appropriate points within, production areas. Such hand-washing facilities shall provide, at a 
minimum:

• advisory signs to prompt hand-washing
• a sufficient quantity of water at a suitable temperature
• water taps with hands-free operation
• liquid/foam soap
• single-use towels or suitably designed and located air driers.

Interpretation Hand-washing facilities

Dedicated hand-washing facilities must be provided at entrances to production areas and, 
where appropriate, at additional points within production areas. This is to ensure that hands 
are physically washed, rather than just sanitised, before starting work and as necessary during 
the working day. In some low-risk operations, the hand-wash prior to entry to the production 
area may be in a changing facility or toilet rather than within the entrance to the actual 
production area. In some dry environments where water is avoided, gel or alcohol sanitisers 
may be used in the production areas in place of hand-washing facilities, although staff will 
still be required to wash their hands before entering the production area.

The hand-washing facilities must be equipped with the following:

• hand-washing signage to prompt hand-washing at the relevant points in the process
• appropriate instructions for use, considering the language needs of staff (e.g. including 

pictorial instructions). For example, good practice is to instruct staff on how to wash in a 
thorough and appropriate manner and for the correct length of time (usually at least 20 
seconds)

• water in sufficient quantities and at a suitable temperature. The publication WHO 
Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care (recommended by Codex Alimentarius) 
highlights that warm water is more effective at cleaning than cooler water, with 40°C 
being demonstrably more effective than 20°C. It also notes that warm water is preferable 
to hot water because repeated exposure to hot water increases the risk of dermatitis 
(comfortably warm is generally considered to be about 45°C)

• taps that have hands-free operation (e.g. knee- or foot-operated taps or those with 
movement sensors)

• liquid or foam soap solution
• suitable hygienic hand-drying facilities (either single-use hand towels or suitably designed 

and located hand driers; roller towels are not acceptable as they are not single use). Where 
single-use towels are used, suitably designed and located bins should also be provided.

Good practice is that hand sanitiser is also provided at all hand-washing facilities. (Hand 
sanitiser is always required for high-risk and high-care operations – see clause 8.4.1.)

The provision and location of hand-wash basins are expected to follow industry best practice 
within that sector, including a risk assessment for breakage or damage. For some low-risk 
operations where hand-washing facilities are only provided within toilets before re-entering 
production, the requirements for hand-washing facilities will also apply to toilet areas.

Clause Requirements
4.8.5 Toilets shall be adequately segregated and shall not open directly into production or packing 

areas. Toilets shall be provided with hand-washing facilities comprising:

• basins with soap and water at a suitable temperature
• adequate hand-drying facilities
• advisory signs to prompt hand-washing.

Where hand-washing facilities within toilets are the only hand-washing facilities provided 
before re-entering production, the requirements of clause 4.8.4 shall apply and signs shall 
be in place to direct people to hand-washing facilities before entering production.

Interpretation Toilets

Toilets must be adequately segregated from production areas and must not open directly 
into production or packing areas. There should be an intermediate ventilated space between 
the toilet cubicle and any production area to prevent foul odours from entering production 
areas.

The hand-washing facilities provided in toilets must be equipped with:

• appropriate instructions for use, considering the language needs of staff
• sufficient water at a suitable temperature (clause 4.8.4)
• soap (in any format)
• suitable hand-drying facilities (in any format).

Where hand-washing facilities within toilet facilities are the only ones provided before 
re-entering production, the requirements of clause 4.8.4 apply, including suitable signage to 
direct staff to wash their hands prior to entering production areas.

4.8.6 Where smoking is allowed under national law, designated controlled smoking areas shall be 
provided which are both isolated from production areas to an extent that ensures smoke 
cannot reach the product and fitted with sufficient extraction to the exterior of the building. 
Adequate arrangements for dealing with smokers’ waste shall be provided at smoking 
facilities, both inside and at exterior locations. Electronic cigarettes shall not be permitted 
to be used or brought into production or storage areas.

Interpretation Smoking areas

Facilities in line with national legislation must be provided for those staff wishing to smoke. 
These facilities must not be located within the packing or production areas where there 
is open food or ingredients, or where smoke could reach product or ingredients. Indoor 
facilities must have sufficient extraction to the exterior of the building.

Procedures for protective clothing and hand-washing must be in place whenever staff enter 
or leave production and packing areas (clause 7.4.1); therefore suitable facilities for staff to 
remove their protective clothing before smoking and for washing their hands afterwards 
must be provided. Signs must direct them to the hand-washing facilities.

There must be sufficient and appropriately positioned facilities for the waste generated by 
those persons smoking.

Where electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are permitted on site, instructions for use must comply 
with national and local legislation. Electronic cigarettes must not be taken into storage, 
processing or production areas.

Clause Requirements
4.8.7 All food brought into manufacturing premises by staff shall be appropriately stored in a 

clean and hygienic state. No food shall be taken into storage, processing or production areas. 
Where eating of food is allowed outside during breaks, this shall be in suitable designated 
areas with appropriate control of waste.

Interpretation Staff food

Suitable storage facilities must be provided for food brought on site by staff, enabling it to 
be stored in a hygienic manner. Where refrigerators are provided for staff food, they should 
be kept clean, maintained and operated at an appropriate temperature. Refrigerators used for 
production materials and shelf-life samples must not be used for storing staff foodstuffs.

Food (including sweets and chewing gum) must not be taken into storage, processing 
or production areas, as it may constitute a risk to the product. Food must be adequately 
controlled when stored in other areas.

All food and drink must be consumed in designated areas away from food-handling, 
production and storage areas. Where appropriate, designated outside areas can be provided 
for staff to eat food; where provided, these must have an appropriate control of waste.

Drinking of water from purpose-made dispensers by using disposable conical cups or spill-
proof containers may be allowed, provided it is confined to a designated area, minimising the 
risk to product, and suitable disposal facilities are provided.

4.8.8 Where catering facilities (including vending machines) are provided on the premises, they 
shall be suitably controlled to prevent contamination of products (e.g. as a source of food 
poisoning, the use of allergenic ingredients or introduction of new allergenic material to the 
site).

Interpretation Catering facilities

Where the company provides a canteen or other food service (including food vending 
services) for members of staff, the kitchens and cold-storage areas need to be suitably 
controlled to prevent the contamination of products (e.g. by microbiological or allergen 
contamination).

In the absence of specific legislative requirements and assessments for the control of 
hazards in catering facilities, a study based on HACCP principles should have been carried 
out on any catering facilities provided for the staff. The risks identified should be effectively 
controlled – in particular, those associated with staff hygiene, cleaning, cross-contamination 
between raw and cooked foods, and storage conditions.

Where hot food is prepared within a site’s facilities, additional safe food-handling may be 
required; for example, the WHO’s Five Keys to Safer Food Manual promoting safe food-
handling highlights the need to:

• keep clean – wash hands and keep kitchens and food preparation areas washed and 
sanitised

• separate raw and cooked foodstuffs, and keep the utensils or equipment used for handling 
them separated

• cook or reheat products thoroughly

• store food at appropriate temperatures to maintain food safety; for example, using fridges 
and freezers, and keeping cooked food hot before serving

• use water of an appropriate quality to ensure that it is not the source of a food safety hazard.

The Standard requires sites to consider whether there are risks of product contamination 
from catering activities and vending machines, and, where appropriate, ensure that suitable 
company policies are in place to manage these risks. For example, in some operations (e.g. 
sites manufacturing a product with an allergen-free claim), specific allergens may present a 
particular risk. These sites should specify any relevant company policies to confectionery 
vending suppliers and catering facilities.

At the BRCGS audit, there will be a basic inspection of the kitchen facilities. Catering 
facilities should be part of the site’s own internal audit or hygiene inspection programme.

4.9 Chemical and physical product contamination control: raw material-handling, 
preparation, processing, packing and storage areas

Appropriate facilities and procedures shall be in place to control the risk of chemical or physical contamination 
of product.

Interpretation

The risk of foreign-body and chemical contamination must be minimised through the consideration of potential 
sources and the implementation of control procedures within the HACCP or food safety plan. Areas to consider 
include storage, processing, equipment, maintenance, building structures, cleaning operations and personnel.

Staff facilities and communal areas such as entrance corridors also need to be considered to ensure that their design 
and the processes carried out within them do not pose a risk to products (e.g. the presence of staples or drawing 
pins on open noticeboards). Regular documented inspections (clause 3.4.4) must be carried out to verify that these 
controls are in place.

It is often useful for sites to consider physical contamination controls in three tiers, as shown in Figure 14.

Where possible, eliminate the hazard. For example:
• remove unnecessary glass and wood
• ban staples in raw material packaging.

Where necessary, use control procedures to prevent the
risk. For example:
• debagging and deboxing procedures that avoid
• creating fragments of packaging.

Where the above are not possible, use materials that are
easy to detect. For example:
• metal detectable closures
• plastic liners with contrasting colours
• plasters that are both coloured and metal detectable.

4.9.1 Chemical control

Clause Requirements
4.9.1.1 Processes shall be in place to manage the use, storage and handling of non-food chemicals 

to prevent chemical contamination. These shall include, at a minimum:

• an approved list of chemicals for purchase
• availability of material safety data sheets and specifications
• confirmation of suitability for use in a food-processing environment
• avoidance of strongly scented products
• the labelling and/or identification of containers of chemicals at all times
• a designated storage area (separate from chemicals used as raw materials in products) with 

access restricted to authorised personnel
• use by trained personnel only
• procedures to manage any spills
• procedures for the safe, legal disposal or return of obsolete or out-of-date chemicals and 

empty chemical containers.

Interpretation Storage and handling of non-food chemicals

Non-food chemicals present a potential product contamination or taint risk if they are 
not stored and handled correctly. The site needs to demonstrate controls for non-food 
chemicals, including the following:

• an approved list of chemicals for purchase – this is to prevent inappropriate chemicals 
from being purchased. This applies to all cleaning chemicals, pesticides and other 
chemicals which may be used in the production environment

• material safety data sheets and specifications provided by the supplier. These should be 
up to date and accurate for the chemicals currently used by the site

• confirmation that the chemicals are suitable for use in a food-processing area (i.e. they are 
non-tainting and not highly toxic). For example, cleaning chemicals must be selected to 
avoid the risk of product tainting (chemicals such as phenolics and those that are strongly 
scented are not suitable)

• avoidance of strong-scented products
• identification of chemicals (e.g. labelling of all containers) at all times, to minimise the 

potential for inadvertent use
• designated storage with restricted access limited to authorised personnel. Potentially 

harmful chemicals (e.g. sodium hypochlorite) must be suitably stored to prevent 
inadvertent product contamination. Sites should ensure that safe-use/storage instructions 
from the manufacturer are implemented (e.g. store acid and alkaline materials away from 
each other and store powders above liquids to prevent subsequent reaction in the event 
of spillage. Good practice also includes supplying cleaning chemicals to production areas 
ready diluted (for use with verified auto-dosing systems) and to ensure that stocks of 
cleaning chemicals not required for the current production or cleaning activity are stored 
away from the production area

• ensuring that chemicals that are food raw materials are stored separately from non-food 
chemicals, to prevent potential contamination from non-food materials into the food raw 
materials

• use of chemicals by trained personnel only, as evidenced by training records

• application of procedures to manage any spills, to ensure they do not pose a risk to 
product safety; for example, good practice is to provide bunded areas around appropriate 
chemical and oil tanks and ensure that relevant staff are trained in the spillage procedures.

Procedures must be in place for the safe, legal disposal of obsolete or out-of-date 
chemicals and empty chemical containers, to ensure chemical waste is disposed of in the 
correct manner (for example, by disposing of chemicals and containers in accordance with 
legislative requirements, using licensed waste disposal contractors, and by returning them 
to the manufacturer). Procedures must cover unused chemicals (i.e. those that are no longer 
required) and empty containers.

Chemicals that are likely to come into direct contact with foods when used as intended (e.g. 
materials such as oils or lubricants used on machinery), as well as terminal sanitisers that are 
designed to be used without rinsing with water, should be confirmed as suitable for food use. 
(This would not include general detergents and cleaning materials, as these should not come 
into direct contact with food.)

Consideration may need to be given to the legislative requirements of specific countries, 
states or territories. For example, legislation may require that materials do not contain toxic 
or prohibited substances, that lubricants are suitable for food use or that terminal sanitisers 
meet applicable standards (e.g. the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No. 528/2012).

4.9.1.2 Where strongly scented or taint-forming materials have to be used, for instance for building 
work, procedures shall be in place to prevent the risk of taint contamination of products.

Interpretation Strong scents and taints

Wherever possible, strongly scented or taint-forming materials must not be used. However, 
where these are necessary (e.g. for some building work), procedures must be in place to 
avoid the risk of taint contamination of products. For example, relevant information must 
be requested from contractors, detailing the chemicals to be used and the controls (such as 
the extraction of fumes) that will need to be in place. A risk assessment of the information 
should be completed prior to commencement of the work.

4.9.2 Metal control

Clause Requirements
4.9.2.1 There shall be a documented policy for the controlled use and storage of sharp metal 

implements including knives, cutting blades on equipment, needles and wires. This shall 
include a record of inspection for damage and the investigation of any lost items. Snap-off 
blade knives shall not be used.

Interpretation Sharp metal implements

Where sharp metals such as knives, needles or cheese wires are used, there must be a 
documented policy. This will outline:

• the controls in place
• inspection and breakage/loss reporting procedures
• storage when not in use
• other controls, such as the numbering of knives or the use of issue and return logs.

The company should aim to ensure that shards of missing metal are located and that the 
source of any loose metal is identified.

Snap-off blades (i.e. where the old segment of blade can be snapped off to reveal a new 
sharp edge) are a source of potential metal contamination and are not permitted in any area 
of production or storage. Other metal items, such as non-production blades, engineering 
tools and equipment, must be stored away from production areas to minimise their potential 
for contaminating product. For example, spanners used for adjusting machinery should not 
be left out, but should have a designated place for storage, such as a locked toolbox fixed to 
a wall.

4.9.2.2 The purchase of ingredients and packaging which use staples or other foreign-body hazards 
as part of the packaging materials shall be avoided.

Staples, paper clips and drawing pins shall not be used in open product areas.

Where staples or other items are present as packaging materials or closures, appropriate 
precautions shall be taken to minimise the risk of product contamination.

Interpretation Staples, paper clips and similar metallic items

Staples are often used in packaging. However, their use needs to be considered, since 
they are a potential source of contamination and the purchase of ingredients or packaging 
materials containing them must be avoided. Where ingredients with potential foreign bodies 
cannot be avoided, there need to be controls to manage these hazards.

Staples, paper clips and drawing pins (i.e. thumb tacks or pin tacks) or other metal closures 
must not be used in open product areas.

4.9.3 Glass, brittle plastic, ceramics and similar materials

Clause Requirements
4.9.3.1 Glass or other brittle materials shall be excluded or protected against breakage in areas 

where open products are handled or there is a risk of product contamination.

Interpretation Exclusion of unnecessary materials

The aim of this clause is to protect consumers from potentially serious physical hazards that 
could occur if glass, brittle plastic, ceramics or other similar materials in open product areas 
of the site, are broken and form fragments which could subsequently contaminate product.

The company must undertake an assessment of glass and other brittle items in open 
product areas, and any areas where there is a risk of contamination of product or packaging 
and, wherever possible, remove these items. Where it is not possible to remove all items, 
they must be protected against breakage (e.g. by the use of adhesive plastic sheeting, 
reinforcement or shielding) and included on a register for inspection purposes (clause 
4.9.3.2).

This does not apply to glass or brittle materials used to pack final products, which are 
covered separately in section 4.9.4.

Clause Requirements
4.9.3.2 Procedures for handling glass and other brittle materials (other than product packaging) shall 

be in place where open products are handled or there is a risk of product contamination. 
These procedures shall include, at a minimum:

• a list of items detailing location, number, type and condition
• recorded checks of the condition of items, carried out at a specified frequency that is 

based on the level of risk to the product
• details on cleaning or replacing items to minimise the potential for product contamination.

Interpretation Documented handling procedures

Procedures for handling glass and similar materials (other than packaging, which is covered in 
section 4.9.4) need to be documented to ensure that the risks of product contamination are 
managed.

The documentation must include:

• a list or register of items, detailing their location, number, type and condition. When 
creating the list, it is important to be realistic; the objective is to remove brittle items 
where possible and create a list of items for inspection which present a real risk of 
breakage and contamination of products (i.e. those that are in open product areas or where 
risk assessment shows there is a genuine risk to product). (The list could also detail the 
frequency with which the items must be checked.)

• recorded, routine inspections to verify the condition of these items. Inspections must be 
carried out at a specified frequency based on risk assessment; some areas may be checked 
more frequently than others because of their potential to form a foreign-body hazard 
in the product. (For example, a factory identifies part of the production line which has 
plastic-laminated line covers that may chip or break. The condition of this section of the 
line is specifically checked daily prior to production, because it is above open food and 
any breakage or damage is likely to result in a foreign-body issue. The same factory has 
a brittle plastic dial cover on a control panel on the exterior of a piece of equipment not 
close to open product. This is checked only monthly, as a break and subsequent foreign-
body issue is unlikely to arise.)

• maintaining a record of the inspection even when there is no change in the condition of 
the inspected items. Any non-conformities highlighted in previous inspections, but not 
permanently repaired, should also be checked to confirm no additional deterioration has 
occurred

• the procedures that allow cleaning or replacement of items in a way that minimises 
potential risk to products (e.g. replacing bulbs in fly-killing devices).

Further guidance Developing an effective glass control programme

To start with, carry out an assessment of the glass and brittle plastic items in open product 
areas and, wherever possible, remove them (see clause 4.9.3.1). If the item cannot be 
removed, it must be protected against breakage (e.g. with adhesive sheets or reinforcements) 
and included on a register for inspection purposes (an example is shown in Figure 15).

When creating a list of items for inspection, it is important to be realistic. The objective is 
to create a list of items that represent a real risk of breakage and product contamination. 
For example, the window above the production line is likely to be high-risk, as any breakage 
is likely to contaminate the product. But the window in the Director’s office, on the other 
side of the site, does not need to be included unless there is a genuine risk of product 
contamination if the window breaks.

Further guidance 
continued

The frequency of the inspections must be based on risk assessment. The quality of the 
risk assessment is important as some items will probably be checked infrequently because 
of their lower risk status, whereas others may require frequent checks because of their 
prominent location and associated risk. For example, checking the window above the 
production line is likely to form part of the daily line start-up procedures.

You must ensure you have a contingency procedure in place that allows the reporting and 
timely management of any breakage (i.e. if an item is found to be damaged or broken during 
an inspection or if an item breaks during use).

There are a number of risk assessment techniques that can be used within food sites and 
the Standard is not prescriptive about which should be selected. However, there are two key 
considerations in relation to glass and brittle materials:

• the potential for damage or breakage
• the location and consequently the likelihood of a broken fragment contaminating a food 

product.

The importance of good documentation and record-keeping

Five key documents are required:

• a list of items giving details of their location, number, type and condition
• a risk assessment defining the required frequency of checks
• records of the routine inspections to verify the condition of these items (see examples in 

Figures 16 and 17)
• procedures that allow the cleaning or replacement of items in a way that minimises 

potential risk to products
• a procedure for the management of any breakages (see clause 4.9.3.3).

A record of the checks must be maintained even when there is no change to the status of 
the item (see examples in Figure 16 and 17). This is to demonstrate that the checks were 
made, so that in the event of a breakage you can be confident that the item was intact at the 
previous scheduled inspection, allowing any investigation or action to focus on a defined 
time period.

Interpretation Breakage procedures

There must be documented procedures detailing the course of action to be taken when a 
breakage of a glass, brittle or hard plastic material, ceramic or similar item occurs. This must 
be based on risk assessment (therefore, the action taken may depend on the area in which 
the breakage occurred) and should include:

• who has been trained to clear up broken items safely while minimising risks to product 
safety

• isolation, inspection and management (e.g. product disposal) of potentially contaminated 
product (raw materials, packaging, final product etc.)

• isolation of potentially contaminated area (e.g. specifying a 10-m exclusion zone)
• how to clear up the broken item, including any designated equipment such as a brush, 

shovel and bin
• how to clean the area and which cleaning equipment to use – this is important to ensure 

that glass particles are not transferred on equipment from one area to another
• how to dispose of debris
• inspection of the production area after cleaning, and the authorisation to recommence 

production
• changing of production clothing (staff and cleaners)
• inspection of footwear (staff and cleaners)
• records to keep
• identification of authorised staff to complete each of the above actions.

The site should consider how to remove broken items, particularly larger items, from the 
premises. A designated, authorised contractor may be required.

Further guidance Typical steps to take in the event of a glass breakage

In the event of a breakage, the following procedure must be followed:

• Notify a responsible person. (The site must identify the supervisors, line managers or 
production managers who should be notified and they should have sufficient knowledge 
and authority to take action.)

• Where the breakage occurs near open product (e.g. near a production line), production in 
the area should be stopped.

• Isolate the area of the breakage to ensure glass is not inadvertently distributed to other 
areas.

• Discard products in the area that are contaminated or likely to be contaminated. If the 
break is discovered during a routine inspection, it will be necessary to consider all the 
products that have been manufactured since the last satisfactory inspection and the 
possibility that these may be contaminated.

• Carefully clear the broken glass. The site should have specific cleaning equipment.
• Once the area has been cleaned, it should be inspected and signed off before production 

resumes.
• A record of all breakages should be maintained.

4.9.3.4 Where they pose a risk to product, glass windows shall be protected against breakage.

Interpretation Protection of windows against breakage

Where it has been assessed that glass windows (including glazing in walls) pose a risk to 
product (e.g. where they are in close proximity to production or storage areas), they must be 
protected against breakage. This could be achieved by the use of adhesive plastic sheeting.

4.9.3.5 Where they pose a risk to product, bulbs and strip lights (including those on electric fly-
killer devices) shall be adequately protected. Where full protection cannot be provided, 
alternative management such as wire-mesh screens or monitoring procedures shall be in 
place.

Interpretation Protection of lights against breakage

The site must assess where light bulbs and strip lights pose a risk to product (e.g. where 
they are in close proximity to production, storage areas or staff facilities). Where a risk is 
identified, light bulbs and strip lights must be protected against breakage.

All types of lighting must be considered in order to minimise the likelihood of breakage and 
the spread of glass shards. Depending on the type of lighting used, protection can normally 
be achieved through the appropriate use of shatterproof light tubes, plastic sleeving 
or diffusion covers. Where full protection cannot be achieved, alternative methods of 
management, such as wire-mesh screens or monitoring procedures, must be in place.

4.9.4 Products packed into glass or other brittle containers

Interpretation

Where products are packed into glass or other brittle materials (e.g. ceramic pots), the risk of breakage is increased 
and the packaging materials themselves present a significant foreign-body risk. These requirements deal specifically 
with the additional controls required to reduce the risk of contamination. They do not apply where products are not 
packed into glass or similar brittle containers.

Clause Requirements
4.9.4.1 The storage of the containers shall be segregated from the storage of raw materials, product 

or other packaging.

Interpretation Storage

There must be dedicated, segregated storage for glass or other brittle containers. Ideally a 
separate storage room should be used for storage of empty containers. Where the containers 
are in a shared warehouse, a distinctly separate area must be used. Warehouse product flow 
must be considered to reduce the risk of broken glass or fragments being carried into raw 
material storage areas.

Clause Requirements
4.9.4.2 Systems shall be in place to manage container breakages between the container-cleaning/

inspection point and container closure. This shall include, as a minimum, documented 
instructions which ensure:

• the removal and disposal of at-risk products in the vicinity of the breakage; this may be 
specific for different equipment or areas of the production line

• the effective cleaning of the line or equipment which may be contaminated by fragments 
of the container; cleaning shall not result in the further dispersal of fragments, for 
instance by the use of high-pressure water or air

• the use of dedicated, clearly identifiable cleaning equipment (e.g. colour-coded) for 
removal of container breakages; such equipment shall be stored separately from other 
cleaning equipment

• the use of dedicated, accessible, lidded waste containers for the collection of damaged 
containers and fragments

• a documented inspection of production equipment is undertaken following the cleaning 
of a breakage, to ensure cleaning has effectively removed any risk of further contamination

• authorisation given for production to restart following cleaning
• the area around the line being kept clear of broken glass.

Interpretation Breakages

The documented instructions for dealing with breakages must cover those points listed in 
the requirement. However, where high-speed filling lines are used with automatic breakage 
detection and cleaning systems, not all these will be practical. In such cases, the site must 
be able to demonstrate that the system is capable of consistently and safely removing glass 
fragments, and that factors such as low water pressure which may affect the performance of 
the acceptance and/or rejection of implicated products are understood, documented and 
controlled.

4.9.4.3 Records shall be maintained of all container breakages on the line. Where no breakages 
have occurred during a production period, this shall also be recorded. This record shall be 
reviewed to identify trends and potential line or container improvements.

Interpretation Records

All breakages must be recorded. This record should include:

• the location where the breakage occurred
• a record of the action taken
• sign-off by an authorised member of staff, e.g. a shift leader, production manager or quality 

assurance representative, who is trained and competent.

Where no breakages have occurred during a production period, this must also be recorded.

The records must be periodically reviewed to identify trends (the use of a glass breakage 
map may be useful in identifying any trends in the locations where breakages occur). The 
results must be reviewed, for example, during the management review of incidents (clause 
1.1.4), to identify opportunities to reduce the risk of glass breakages.

4.9.5 Wood

Clause Requirements
4.9.5.1 Wood should not be used in open product areas except where this is a process requirement 

(e.g. maturation of products in wood). Where the use of wood cannot be avoided, its 
condition shall be monitored on a risk-based frequency to ensure it is in good condition and 
free from damage or splinters which could contaminate products.

Wood used for food contact purposes shall be fit for purpose (e.g. free from damage or 
splinters, free from taint; and wood treatments, where used, are used only in accordance 
with legislation and approved for food use).

Interpretation Wood in open product areas

The use of wood is not permitted in production areas except where it is a requirement of 
the process (e.g. wooden casks used for some alcoholic beverages, or wooden crates for 
incoming raw materials in fresh produce packhouses).

Where wood cannot be avoided, a procedure must be in place to:

• ensure the use of wood is covered by the HACCP risk assessment
• identify damaged items
• minimise the potential for contamination
• ensure that the wood is monitored (e.g. by regular checks on a risk-based frequency to 

ensure it is in good condition and clean).

Wooden pallets should not be present in open product areas unless there is an essential and 
justified need, which cannot reasonably be avoided. The site must be able to demonstrate 
that the presence of the pallet will not result in a product contamination risk. For example, 
controls might include:

• not using wooden pallets in open product areas
• designated areas for pallet use (e.g. only at the end of the packing line)
• inspection of the pallets before entry to the production area.

Where wood is intended for food contact purposes, it must be fit for purpose. This may, for 
example, include being:

• free from damage or splinters which could result in foreign bodies migrating into the 
products

• free from chemical contamination which could migrate into the products, including taint
• cleaned or managed to prevent microbiological contamination
• used only in accordance with any relevant legislation; for example, any wood treatments 

must be approved for food use, and in the EU, the Framework Regulation EC 1935/2004 
stipulates that food contact materials shall not release their constituents into food in 
quantities which could cause deterioration in the food’s organoleptic characteristics (i.e. 
its taste and smell).

4.9.6 Other physical contaminants

Clause Requirements
4.9.6.1 Procedures shall be in place to prevent physical contamination of raw materials by raw 

material packaging (e.g. during debagging and deboxing procedures to remove the packaging).

Interpretation Raw material packaging

Raw materials are delivered to sites in a variety of packaging formats composed of different 
materials (including cardboard boxes, paper liners, plastic bags, sacks, etc.) and with different 
types of closure (metal fixtures, glue, tape, thread, etc.). Sites must ensure that the risk of 
these packaging materials contaminating the raw material is prevented.

Where packaging is removed from raw materials prior to use, documented procedures 
must be in place so that staff completing the activity know how to do so without creating a 
contamination hazard to the raw material.

4.9.6.2 Portable handheld equipment, e.g. stationery items (pens, pencils etc.), mobile phones, 
tablets and similar portable items used in open product areas, shall be controlled by the site 
to minimise the risk of physical contamination. The site may consider, for example:

• excluding non-approved items
• restricting the use to site-issued equipment
• ensuring stationery items such as pens are designed without small external parts and are 

detectable by foreign-body detection equipment, or are used in designated areas where 
contamination is prevented.

Interpretation Control of portable handheld equipment

The aim of the clause is to minimise or prevent potential product contamination from pens 
and small portable items such as stationery, mobile phones and tablets.

The type of control applied will depend on the nature of the process, the site, and the 
potential for contamination should those items be lost or damaged in the production or 
storage area. Suitable controls may include:

• restricting portable items to those approved and issued by the site
• use of metal detectable equipment
• restricting approved items to those with no small external parts, so that any breakage will 

not result in small pieces of undetectable plastic in product.

The Standard is not prescriptive in the control mechanisms used. For example, it is common 
for pens used in production areas to be metal detectable; however, other controls may be 
more suitable in certain circumstances. Therefore metal detection is provided as an example 
of a common control. Nor does the Standard require pens to be of a specific design, or state 
that most pens available on the market are not compliant. The Standard does not require 
the site to test every batch of pens through its metal detector. It does, however, require sites 
to consider the design of pens and portable items being used, to ensure that potential food 
safety hazards have been considered and are managed appropriately.

4.9.6.3 Based on risk, procedures shall be implemented to minimise other types of foreign-body 
contamination (i.e. types of contamination that are not specifically covered in section 4.9).

Interpretation Other types of foreign-body contamination

The aim of this clause is to ensure that sites have considered all of the different types of 
foreign-body risks that may reasonably be expected to occur within their site, and have 
introduced suitable controls. For example, this may include significant foreign bodies 
identified during the development of the food safety plan (see clause 2.7.1) but not already 
managed through the other clauses in section 4.9.

Where risk assessment shows that a genuine risk exists, the site will need to introduce 
suitable control procedures.

4.10 Foreign-body detection and removal equipment

The risk of product contamination shall be reduced or eliminated by the effective use of equipment to remove or 
detect foreign bodies.

Interpretation

The risk of foreign-body contamination must be minimised using food industry best practice, such as X-ray 
inspection, metal detection, sieves, magnets or scanner technology.

BRCGS has produced a guideline to foreign-body detection which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or 
viewed online at BRCGS Participate.

4.10.1 Selection and operation of foreign-body detection and removal equipment

Clause Requirements
4.10.1.1 A documented assessment in association with the food safety plan (see section 2 – The 

food safety plan) shall be carried out on each production process to identify the potential 
use of equipment to detect or remove foreign-body contamination. Typical equipment to be 
considered may include:

• filters and sieves
• metal detection and X-ray detection equipment
• magnets
• optical sorting equipment
• other physical separation equipment (e.g. gravity separation, fluid bed technology).

Interpretation Documented assessment

The food safety plan should be the starting point for implementing an effective foreign-
body control programme. Potential hazards and their sources must be identified so that 
appropriate control procedures can be put in place to minimise the likelihood of product 
contamination. The Standard lists some of the most common forms of equipment used.

4.10.1.2 The type, location and sensitivity of the detection and/or removal method shall be specified 
as part of the site’s documented system. Industry best practice shall be applied with regard 
to the nature of the ingredient, material, product and/or packed product. The location of 
the equipment or any other factors influencing the sensitivity of the equipment shall be 
validated and justified.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Type, location and sensitivity

The choice of location for foreign-body detection equipment is vital for its effective use. 
Equipment should be placed as close to the end of the production process as is practical, so 
that the whole process (including packing lines) is protected.

When selecting equipment and determining the best location for it, the potential 
environmental effects (e.g. temperature, moisture or speed of line) should be considered and 
discussed with the equipment supplier.

The sensitivity of detectors must be specified and best practice applied, taking into account 
the nature of the food, contamination characteristics, and the location and aperture size of 
the detector. For example, it is likely that metal detectors will be sensitive to ferrous, non-
ferrous and stainless steel test pieces, using test sizes according to industry best practice 
for the particular product type or customer requirements. Good practice is for foreign-body 
detectors to have adequate security settings so that only authorised personnel can alter 
them.

The Standard expects the detector and its location to be validated at set-up; for example, 
by adjusting the machine’s sensitivity using a range of typical products to establish the most 
sensitive practical setting which gives rise to consistent rejection without false rejects.

The established settings must be recorded and verified through regular checks of the 
equipment; these checks are generally undertaken using test pieces of a size just above the 
limit of detection.

4.10.1.3 The site shall ensure that the frequency of the testing of the foreign-body detection and/or 
removal equipment is defined and takes into consideration:

• specific customer requirements
• the site’s ability to identify, hold and prevent the release of any affected materials, should 

the equipment fail.

The site shall establish and implement corrective action and reporting procedures in the 
event of a failure of the foreign-body detector and/or removal equipment. Action shall 
include a combination of isolation, quarantining and re-inspection of all products produced 
since the last successful test or inspection.

Interpretation System monitoring and corrective action

The frequency of testing of the monitoring equipment must be assessed and defined in 
procedures. The frequency of routine tests should consider:

• the need for additional checks at start-up and finish of shifts
• product changeovers
• the need for regular checks throughout production (hourly testing is expected for many 

detection systems)
• changes in machine settings or following downtime
• any specific customer requirements
• the site’s ability to recover and retest product in the event of a failure.

In the event that equipment is discovered not to be working, all of the product that has 
passed through the detector since it was last verified to be working must be rechecked.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

There must be procedures in place specifying the action required in the event of the 
detector failing a routine test (e.g. failing to detect or reject a test piece).

The people responsible for completing the tests must also be trained in this procedure 
(clause 7.1.1). The procedures must include a combination of isolation, quarantining and 
re-inspection of all products produced since the last successful test.

If the cause of the failure is a system fault, the fault should be repaired before 
recommencing production on the implicated line.

4.10.1.4 Where foreign material is detected or removed by the equipment, the source of any 
unexpected material shall be investigated. Information on rejected materials shall be used to 
identify trends and, where possible, instigate preventive action to reduce the occurrence of 
contamination by the foreign material.

Interpretation Investigation of rejected material

Products rejected or retained by detection systems can provide valuable information about 
possible problems arising from raw materials or the production process, and provide an early 
warning of potential issues.

Rejected products should therefore be examined to identify the cause of rejection. 
Identified causes should be investigated and recorded.

The data on rejected and retained product must also be used as the basis for analysing 
trends. This trend analysis may be used to establish preventive actions to reduce future 
contamination. Information about false rejects should also be recorded, because this 
may suggest an error with the detector or indicate that the settings are too sensitive for a 
particular product and require adjustment.

4.10.2 Filters and sieves

Clause Requirements
4.10.2.1 Filters and sieves used for foreign-body control shall be of a specified mesh size or gauge 

and designed to provide the maximum practical protection for the product.

Interpretation Mesh and gauge size

To ensure the system provides maximum protection, consideration must be given to mesh 
and gauge size. The smallest practical size should be used.

The size will be documented and details made easily available to staff using the equipment.

4.10.2.2 Filters and sieves shall be regularly inspected or tested for damage at a documented 
frequency based on risk. Records shall be maintained of the checks. Where defective 
filters or sieves are identified, this shall be recorded and the potential for contamination of 
products investigated and appropriate action taken.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Routine inspection

Filters and sieves must be monitored to ensure they themselves do not pose a foreign-body 
hazard and are working effectively. There must be a documented procedure which includes:

• the frequency of checks – this should be based on the nature of the sieve (e.g. a 
perforated-drum sieve is less likely to fail than a wire-mesh sieve), historical evidence of 
performance, risk to finished product, and the site’s ability to recover product in the event 
of a failure. Sieves are typically inspected at least once per week. The results of sieve 
monitoring must be recorded

• staff responsibilities
• the action to be taken when issues are identified.

The material from which sieves and filters are manufactured should be considered, to 
minimise the potential for breakages that lead to foreign-body issues (e.g. where sieves or 
filters are used as part of a justification for not requiring metal detection, they should be 
made of non-metallic mesh).

Where defective filters or sieves are identified, this must be recorded, the potential for 
contamination of products investigated, and appropriate action taken.

Depending on the type of sieve or filter used, the site may choose to use visual inspection 
or a sieve analysis which compares results of the sample for particle size retention. This is 
often useful for quality control purposes.

4.10.3 Metal detectors and X-ray equipment

Clause Requirements
4.10.3.1 Metal detection equipment shall be in place unless risk assessment demonstrates that this 

does not improve food safety. Where metal detectors are not used, justification shall be 
documented. The absence of metal detection would only normally be based on the use of 
an alternative, more effective method of protection (e.g. use of X-ray, fine sieves or filtration 
of products).

Interpretation Requirement for metal detection

The Standard presumes that metal detection provides improved food safety and protection 
for customers and should form part of the food protection system of a site. Its absence 
would normally only be based on the use of an alternative, more effective, method of 
protection (e.g. the use of X-ray, fine sieves or filtration). There will, however, be situations 
where metal detection does not, on the basis of risk assessment, provide any significant 
additional protection to the consumer; for example, where whole pieces of fresh produce 
(e.g. potatoes) are being washed and packed, and any metal contamination would be obvious 
to the consumer prior to consumption.

Where metal detectors are not used, a risk assessment must be available to justify the 
reasons why. While complaint levels are a factor in making a decision on the necessity for 
a metal detector, this evidence alone will not be sufficient justification for not using one. 
(For example, there may be instances of contamination which have not been reported by 
consumers.) Any justification for the absence of metal detection should be based on the 
nature of the product, the risk to the consumer, and alternative controls in place at the site 
which prevent metal contamination. Cost alone is not sufficient reason.

In all circumstances where products are manufactured to a customer’s specification, sites 
must comply with any customer requirement for metal detection of their products. The 
decision tree in Figure 18 provides further guidance on the need for metal detection 
equipment for products not packed into metallic containers.

Where the product is packed into metal packaging, an effective alternative test method must 
be developed (e.g. X-ray or metal-detecting the product at the stage prior to packing, or the 
use of magnets and product inspection).

Failsafes or alarms should be implemented to notify production staff when failure of 
equipment is likely. It is vital to know when equipment designed to remove contaminated 
product is not functioning.

Clause Requirements
4.10.3.2 The metal detector or X-ray equipment shall incorporate one of the following:

• an automatic rejection device, for continuous in-line systems, which shall divert 
contaminated product either out of the product flow or to a secure unit accessible only to 
authorised personnel

• a belt stop system with an alarm where the product cannot be automatically rejected (e.g. 
for very large packs)

• in-line detectors which identify the location of the contaminant to allow effective 
segregation of the affected product.

Interpretation Rejection mechanisms

There are a variety of types of metal detector available, and selection will usually be 
dependent on the product and production process; for example, conveyor-based or gravity 
feed systems.

Regardless of the design of the metal detector, the objective of this clause is to ensure 
that rejected products are effectively removed and not accidentally re-introduced into the 
process flow.

The Standard requires the use of automatic rejection devices incorporated into metal 
detection and X-ray equipment.

The use of belt stop and alarm systems is considered by some to present a greater risk 
of ‘rejected’ product being re-introduced into the process flow than automatic rejection 
systems where the product is positively rejected into a locked container. The Standard 
permits the use of either rejection mechanism providing there are sufficient controls in 
place to prevent implicated product being inadvertently placed back into the product flow.

For belt-stop-style metal detector rejection systems, this will typically include the use of 
a container into which rejected product is placed, which is secured so that only authorised 
staff can remove the product (similar to the locked-box system used for automatic rejection 
systems).

Where automatic rejection is not used, the following additional controls should be 
considered to ensure that rejected product is effectively segregated and managed:

• The removal of affected product should be restricted to trained, authorised staff. This may 
be supported by restricting access to the product once the belt has stopped (e.g. by using a 
locked production line cover and authorised key holders).

• Rejected product may be marked, be destroyed or have its label removed to reduce the 
risk of re-introduction to the process flow.

• The line restart should be restricted to designated personnel who must verify the location 
of the ‘rejected’ product prior to restart (i.e. the control panel/button for restart is secure, 
locked or security-coded).

• A record should be made of each occasion when the belt stops in response to the 
detection of metal in a product.

Where the product is packed into metal packaging, an effective alternative test method must 
be developed – for example, the use of X-ray detectors, metal detection, magnets or product 
inspection prior to packing.

Clause Requirements
4.10.3.3 The site shall establish and implement procedures for the operation and testing of the metal 

detection or X-ray equipment. This shall include, at a minimum:

• responsibilities for the testing of equipment
• the operating effectiveness and sensitivity of the equipment and any variation to this for 

particular products
• the methods and frequency of checking the detector
• recording of the results of checks.

Interpretation Documented metal detector and X-ray procedures

The site must have documented procedures for the operation (including effectiveness and 
sensitivity) and routine monitoring of metal detector and X-ray equipment. The procedures 
will identify the individuals authorised to adjust the system as well as those responsible 
for completing system tests. Note that clause 6.1.2 applies to metal detectors and X-ray 
detectors, and good practice is to restrict the adjustment of the systems to a limited number 
of trained, authorised staff, to ensure that any changes are completed and documented 
correctly and in a controlled manner.

The set-up and design of the operating procedures will need to consider a number of 
factors, which will affect the sensitivity of the detector and the effectiveness of the 
rejection mechanisms, including, for example:

• size and type of product – product size and composition can affect the sensitivity of the 
detector and therefore its ability to identify

• product packaging – product is normally tested in pack, but certain types of packaging will 
prevent this

• line operating speeds – there must be sufficient time for the detector to identify the 
presence of a contaminant and the rejection mechanism to accurately and consistently 
remove the implicated pack from the product flow

• location of the detector – should be risk-assessed to ensure that the placement efficiently 
and effectively minimises the risk of foreign bodies in the finished product

• customer-specific requirements – some customers have specific requirements relating to 
detector sensitivity or frequency of tests

• identification of the least sensitive (sometimes referred to as the weakest) part of the 
detector, to ensure that any contaminated product will still be rejected, even if the 
contaminant is located at this weakest point.

The frequency of testing must be based on the quantity and type(s) of product. However, the 
following should be considered:

• start-up and finish of shifts
• product changeovers
• change in machine settings following downtime for repairs
• customer requirements
• regular checks throughout production (these should consider the site’s ability to recover 

and retest product in the event of a failure; therefore a minimum of hourly testing is 
typically expected).

The testing procedures must be based on the requirements of clause 4.10.3.4 but must also 
ensure that all relevant parts of the metal detector are operating correctly (e.g. the timing of 
the rejection system, the memory reset function and any failsafe alarms).

the basis of risk. The test pieces shall be marked with the size and type of test material 
contained

• tests carried out using separate test pieces containing ferrous metal, stainless steel and 
typically non-ferrous metal, unless the product is within a foil container where a ferrous-
only test may be applicable

• a test to prove that both the detection and rejection mechanisms are working effectively 
under normal working conditions

• tests of the metal detector by passing successive test packs through the unit at typical line 
operating speed

• checks of failsafe systems fitted to the detection and rejection systems.

In addition, where metal detectors are incorporated on conveyors, the test piece shall be 
passed as close as possible to the least sensitive area of the metal detector (usually the 
centre of the metal detector aperture). Wherever possible, the test piece shall be inserted 
within a clearly identified sample pack of the food being produced at the time of the test.

Where in-line metal detectors are used, the test piece shall be placed in the product flow 
wherever this is possible, and the correct timing of the rejection system to remove identified 
contamination shall be validated. Testing of in-line metal detectors shall be completed 
during both line start-up and at the end of the production period.

Interpretation Metal detector checking procedures

The company must establish procedures for the operation and routine monitoring of the 
metal detector. Industry best practice, manufacturers’ guidelines and specific customer 
requirements (clause 4.10.1.3) should be considered when developing these procedures.

It is important that the test procedure reflects the normal operation of the production line, 
to provide confidence that any contamination will be correctly detected and removed during 
production. For example, the clause requires:

• completing tests at typical line operating speeds – to ensure detection and rejection 
mechanisms operate correctly at intended line speeds

• placing test pieces within product packs – to ensure product matrix or packaging does not 
adversely affect the metal detector

• use of successive test packs – to ensure the system can effectively detect and, if necessary, 
reject, products immediately after a pack has been rejected.

Interpretation

Many modern designs of metal detector (and other foreign-body detection systems such as 
X-rays) have failsafe systems – that is, they monitor their own functions and raise an alarm 
(usually audible) if something stops working. For example, if a product rejection system is 
powered by compressed air and the air supply fails, this will sound the alarm immediately, 
allowing staff to investigate the fault, rather than waiting until the next metal detector 
check finds a problem. Where these systems exist, it is important to run occasional checks 
to ensure that the failsafe system itself is operating (e.g. that the alarm will sound if one of 
its functions fails). The Standard does not expect sites to purchase new metal detection 
equipment if there is no failsafe system on their current equipment.

Within the procedure, consideration must be given to where the test pieces are located. To 
ensure that the least sensitive areas of the metal detector are able to detect the piece, this is 
usually the centre of the metal detector aperture.

4.10.3.5 X-ray equipment testing procedures shall, at a minimum, include:

• use of test pieces incorporating a sphere of suitable material (e.g. a typical contaminant) 
of a known diameter selected on the basis of risk. The test pieces shall be marked with the 
size and type of test material contained

• tests carried out using separate test pieces
• a test to prove that both the detection and rejection mechanisms are working effectively 

under normal working conditions
• tests of the X-ray equipment by passing successive test packs through the unit at typical 

line operating speed
• checks of failsafe systems fitted to the detection and rejection systems.

In addition, where X-ray equipment is incorporated on conveyors, the test piece shall be 
passed as close as possible to the least sensitive area of the X-ray equipment (e.g. this may 
be close to the X-ray source or close to the X-ray equipment). Wherever possible, the test 
piece shall be inserted into a clearly identified sample pack of the food being produced at 
the time of the test.

Where in-line X-ray equipment is used, the test piece shall be placed in the product flow 
wherever this is possible, and the correct timing of the rejection system to remove identified 
contamination shall be validated. Testing of in-line equipment shall be completed both 
during line start-up and at the end of the production period.

Interpretation X-ray testing procedures

X-ray detectors generally require slightly different test procedures from metal detectors, 
and therefore sites using X-ray equipment must establish procedures for the operation and 
routine monitoring of the X-ray equipment. Industry best practice, manufacturers’ guidelines 
and any customer-specific requirements should also be considered when developing these 
procedures.

The procedure must consider:

• the test pieces – the type of test material chosen should be based on the materials 
reasonably expected to form contaminants within the products being tested. A number of 
different test pieces are likely to be required to ensure all potential hazards are monitored

• a test to prove that both the detection and rejection mechanisms are effective, to ensure 
that foreign bodies are removed if present. These tests should be completed with the line 
running under normal conditions, e.g. with correct line speeds to ensure consistency and 
accuracy under normal conditions

• checking of the failsafe system, to ensure product is removed or held in a separate area 
(further information regarding failsafe systems can be found in the interpretation for 
clause 4.10.3.4).

The test piece should be passed through the X-ray equipment, ensuring that the least 
sensitive area is clearly identified, and this should be included in the procedure. Depending 
on the design of the X-ray equipment, the least sensitive area of the detector may be 
located close to the X-ray source or the detector.

Good practice is to test the system by using test pieces within a clearly identified sample 
pack of the food being produced at the time of the test.

Where in-line X-ray equipment is used, additional consideration will be needed to develop 
an effective test mechanism. For example, the test piece must be placed in the product flow 
wherever possible, and the correct timings of the rejection system confirmed, to ensure 
removal of the test piece. This must be completed at the start-up and end of production. 
Additional testing, where required, should be based on risk.

4.10.4 Magnets

Clause Requirements
4.10.4.1 The type, location and strength of magnets shall be fully documented.

Procedures shall be in place for the inspection, cleaning, strength testing and integrity 
checks of magnets used for food safety purposes, including final product testing, e.g. to 
remove product contamination. Records of all checks shall be maintained.

Interpretation Magnets

Some sectors of the food industry (e.g. grinding of cereals and production of coffee) employ 
magnets to reduce or remove metal fragments in the finished product. Where a magnet is 
used for these food safety purposes, it is important to document its type (e.g. electromagnet 
or permanent magnet), location and strength.

Magnets are not an alternative to metal detectors, but an additional control mechanism, and 
factories using magnets must still comply with the requirements of section 4.10.3.

The magnet’s strength should be designed to ensure that it is sufficient to capture metal 
foreign bodies. A number of factors should be considered when determining the correct 
strength; for example, the type of product (e.g. the size of the food particles), the width of 
the conveyor belt, chute or other equipment in which the magnets are located, and the flow 
rate of the food or raw material.

Documented procedures must be in place to ensure:

• routine inspection (e.g. visual inspection for damage and the presence of captured metal 
fragments)



FOOD SAFETY

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

• cleaning – the ability of a magnet to capture a foreign body can be hampered if dirt or 
other material is allowed to collect on the magnet’s surface

• strength testing (e.g. by using a magnetic meter (measuring the magnet’s strength in tesla) 
or through the use of a third-party calibration service).

Records of all checks, recalibrations or servicing must be maintained.

Clause 4.10.1.3 requires sites to develop test procedures which consider:

• the frequency of testing; for example, to ensure the site can take timely action on 
implicated product in the event of a test failure

• any specific customer requirements.

Good practice for monitoring a magnet’s performance includes locating a second ‘policing’ 
magnet as close to the first as possible. Any metal found on this second magnet indicates 
that the ‘process’ magnet is not performing satisfactorily and is failing to remove all metal 
particles.

4.10.5 Optical sorting equipment

Clause Requirements
4.10.5.1 Optical sorting equipment used for final product testing shall be checked in accordance with 

the manufacturer’s instructions or recommendations. Checks shall be documented.

Interpretation Optical sorting equipment

Optical sorting devices are commonly used in some industries to remove unsatisfactory 
products or contaminants from finished products, usually on the basis of colour or variance 
from a reference material. Where equipment is in use, procedures need to be developed 
for the maintenance and testing of the equipment. This is usually developed with the 
manufacturer when the equipment is installed and commissioned.

Records of all checks and servicing must be maintained.

4.10.6 Container cleanliness – glass jars, cans and other rigid containers

Clause Requirements
4.10.6.1 Based on risk assessment, procedures shall be implemented to minimise foreign-body 

contamination originating from the packaging container (e.g. jars, cans and other pre-formed 
rigid containers). This may include the use of covered conveyors, container inversion and 
foreign-body removal through rinsing with water or air jets.

Interpretation Procedures

Where packaging containers are supplied to the production site in a rigid format (e.g. empty 
cans, bottles or glass jars), there is an increased risk of contamination of the container during 
storage and transit before filling. Glass containers carry the additional risk of damage during 
transit.

Interpretation 
continued

A rigid container is generally any container that is inflexible and would break into separate 
pieces (i.e. small fragments) if pressure was applied, which could subsequently be a foreign-
body hazard. These containers are normally manufactured from glass, metal or inflexible 
plastics or ceramics, although other materials may be used. These types of packaging can 
increase the risk of foreign-body contamination either during the manufacturing process or 
because of breakages during storage and transit.

The site needs to consider the potential risks associated with the containers and introduce 
appropriate controls to reduce the risk. For example, it is usual for such containers to be 
inverted and cleaned prior to use and for glass jars and bottles to be subject to automatic 
or manual (by exception) inspection before use. Where the site uses inversion and cleaning 
(for example, by air jets), it may be necessary to introduce a dust/debris cover, collector or 
control measure to restrict the movement of the removed debris and therefore prevent it 
being moved into a situation where it would become another foreign-body hazard.

Documented procedures, based on risk assessment, must be available to address the 
potential risks.

4.10.6.2 The effectiveness of the container-cleaning equipment shall be checked and recorded 
during each production. Where the system incorporates a rejection system for dirty or 
damaged containers, the check shall incorporate a test of both the detection and effective 
rejection of the test container.

Interpretation Effectiveness of container-cleaning

In-line cleaning and automatic rejection systems are not a requirement of the Standard, but 
the use of such systems is strongly encouraged. Where these systems are present, they must 
be checked and records maintained of checks.

Consideration must also be given to the action required in the event of a breakage after 
cleaning (clause 4.9.3.3).

4.10.7 Other foreign-body detection and removal equipment

Clause Requirements
4.10.7.1 Other foreign-body detection and removal equipment, such as gravity separation, fluid 

bed technology or aspirators, shall be checked in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
instructions or recommendations.

Checks shall be documented.

Interpretation Other removal equipment

All foreign-body detection and removal systems need to be operated correctly to ensure 
that they provide the required level of operation. The clause is applicable to all types of 
equipment not mentioned elsewhere within the Standard; for example:

• gravity separation – a method of separating components in either a suspension or as dry 
granular materials. Gravity separation relies on the components of the material having 
different specific gravities and therefore different relative motion under gravity and drag 
forces

Interpretation

• fluid bed technology – this technology separates particular matter according to size, shape 
and/or density

• aspirators – another technology for separating contaminants on the basis of size, density 
or shape. It can also be used in the removal of loose outer casings from a variety of foods; 
for example, grain hulls.

All removal equipment must be checked in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines 
and instructions to ensure it is being used in the correct way, such that effective removal of 
foreign bodies is consistently achieved.

All checks must be documented and records retained. Good practice is to ensure any non-
conformities are investigated and corrective actions completed in a timely manner.

4.11 Housekeeping and hygiene

Fundamental
Housekeeping and cleaning systems shall be in place which ensure appropriate standards of hygiene 
are maintained at all times and the risk of product contamination is minimised.

Interpretation

Housekeeping is general tidiness, and hygiene is standard of cleanliness, sometimes also referred to as sanitation.

The site must be maintained to a suitable level of cleanliness. Control of hygiene must be achieved through 
schedules of cleaning and policies on housekeeping based on risk assessment. This must be demonstrated 
through documented and monitored systems. The methods of cleaning themselves must not pose a risk of product 
contamination (e.g. from cleaning areas adjacent to open product).

Clause Requirements
4.11.1 The premises and equipment shall be maintained in a clean and hygienic condition.

Interpretation Cleanliness of premises and equipment

It is important that the site, manufacturing environment and equipment are routinely 
cleaned to an appropriate standard of cleanliness to prevent potential contamination 
(e.g. with allergens or micro-organisms) and to prevent quality issues such as taint from 
previously manufactured products.

The Standard requires (clause 4.11.3) that appropriate limits of acceptable cleaning 
performance shall be defined.

During the course of the audit, equipment that is not currently operating will be opened and 
inspected to assess whether cleaning has been completed appropriately and in accordance 
with the site’s policies (including the acceptable limits), as well as to assess post-cleaning 
checks (clause 4.11.5). Production lines that are running will not be stopped for inspection, 
although records may be checked to ensure equipment was appropriately cleaned and 
checked prior to use (see clauses 4.11.2, 4.11.3 and 4.11.5).

4.11.2 Documented cleaning and disinfection procedures shall be in place and maintained for the

food contact surfaces shall, at a minimum, include:

• responsibility for cleaning
• item/area to be cleaned
• frequency of cleaning
• method of cleaning, including dismantling equipment for cleaning purposes where 

required
• cleaning chemicals and concentrations
• cleaning materials to be used
• cleaning records (including records for completion and sign-off) and responsibility for 

verification.

The frequency and methods of cleaning shall be based on risk.

The procedures shall be implemented to ensure appropriate standards of cleaning are 
achieved.

Interpretation Documented cleaning procedures

Documented cleaning and disinfection procedures must be in place to ensure consistent 
and effective cleaning and as a guide for training purposes. When documenting such 
procedures, an emphasis should be placed on the processing equipment and food contact 
surfaces. The procedures must be in sufficient detail for the cleaning to be carried out to 
a consistently acceptable standard. In the majority of sites, good practice would normally 
include six stages of cleaning:

• remove gross debris (e.g. sweep or wipe)
• rinse with water
• wash with detergent solution using hot water
• rinse
• dry
• sanitise.

Where equipment requires different levels of cleaning (e.g. between products, or between 
daily and weekly cleans), each requirement should be clearly detailed and specific to the 
item of equipment. These procedures need to be reviewed and updated whenever changes 
to the equipment and areas to be cleaned occur.

In addition, a good cleaning instruction would include:

• a unique method of reference that can be quoted on paperwork (e.g. cleaning records)
• photographs of equipment, which are useful for identifying equipment and for highlighting 

areas that are difficult to clean, or that form key check/verification points
• the appropriate protective clothing or equipment that should be worn when cleaning or 

handling cleaning chemicals.

Clause Requirements

Further guidance Developing an effective cleaning procedure

In order for cleaning to be effective, it is important that the procedures are designed for the 
specific item, area or site. A generic, off-the-shelf procedure probably would not guarantee 
a sufficient standard of cleaning. For example, an identical work surface in an area handling 
bakery products would need to be treated differently from one in a meat-handling area. 
This would need to be assessed during the development and risk assessment stage. The 
complexity of the process and equipment, the types of product manufactured, the ease with 
which debris can be removed, and the need to manage specific hazards (e.g. specific micro-
organisms or allergens) are also factors to consider.

Developing a cleaning procedure can be done in a few simple steps:

• Step 1  Set the required standard of cleaning (clause 4.11.3)

Consider legislation, customer requirements, industry or category best practice, etc. The 
risk assessment should consider the prevention of contamination from previous products, 
as well as address potential microbiological, chemical or allergen concerns.

• Step 2  Develop draft procedures (clause 4.11.2)

Ensure all items, areas and equipment are defined and included within the procedures. 
Think about the order of cleaning too, so that cleaned equipment is not re-contaminated 
by subsequent cleaning activity.

• Step 3  Validate the draft procedures (clause 4.11.3)

Use validation to confirm that the required standard of cleaning (Step 1) is met. The 
Standard requires that cleaning procedures which form part of a defined prerequisite 
(i.e. procedures that are used to control a specific hazard such as allergen cross-
contamination) must be validated to ensure they are effective and deliver the intended 
level of cleaning. However, it is also good practice for all cleaning procedures to be 
validated.

• Step 4  Finalise procedures and associated documentation (e.g. cleaning records and sign-
off)

Keep records that show what type of cleaning was completed, when it was completed, 
who did it, and who checked the cleaning and signed it off as acceptable (a requirement of 
clause 4.11.2).

• Step 5  Train relevant staff (clause 4.11.4).

• Step 6  Complete ongoing monitoring and verification (clauses 4.11.2 and 4.11.5).

When developing cleaning procedures, it is often useful to remember:

• All equipment and areas must be included.
• Cleaning needs should be discussed with equipment and chemical suppliers, who can 

often provide valuable assistance in identifying suitable cleaning materials.
• Validation and verification are needed for cleaning activities – validation before 

introducing the new procedure, and verification on an ongoing basis. Verification is the 
application of checks or tests, at regular intervals, to ensure the cleaning procedure is still 
working and continues to deliver the required level of cleaning. Verification of cleaning 
may include internal audits, record reviews, swabs or tests of the cleaned equipment, 
and the assessment of staff to ensure they have a clear understanding of the cleaning 
procedure.

4.11.3 Limits of acceptable and unacceptable cleaning performance shall be defined for food 
contact surfaces and processing equipment. These limits shall be based on the potential 
hazards relevant to the product or processing area (e.g. microbiological, allergen, foreign-
body or product-to-product contamination). Therefore, acceptable levels of cleaning 
may be defined by visual appearance, ATP bioluminescence techniques (see glossary), 
microbiological testing, allergen testing or chemical testing as appropriate.

The site shall define the corrective action to be taken when monitored results are outside of 
the acceptable limits.

Where cleaning procedures are part of a defined prerequisite plan to control the risk of 
a specific hazard, the cleaning and disinfection procedures and their frequency shall be 
validated and records maintained. This shall include the risk from cleaning chemical residues 
on food contact surfaces.

Interpretation Cleaning performance limits

At a minimum, limits of acceptable and unacceptable cleaning performance must be defined 
for:

• food contact surfaces
• processing equipment.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9

Clause Requirements

Interpretation

The limits need to be based on risk, and this should be used for assessing whether the 
cleaning undertaken is of an acceptable standard. Acceptable limits may be based on 
visual inspection, ATP monitoring or specific analysis such as microbiological, allergen or 
chemical testing. For example, where the cleaning is principally designed to provide a clean 
processing environment, an assessment of ‘visually clean’ may be sufficient. However, where 
the level of cleaning is to ensure a sterile food contact surface to make sure that all traces of 
an allergen have been removed or to prevent cross-contamination of different meat species, 
the level of acceptable cleaning performance may need to be based on more rigorous 
checks such as the results of ATP, microbiological or allergen tests.

Where the cleaning procedure forms part of a defined prerequisite (section 2.2) designed 
to manage a specific hazard (e.g. allergen cross-contamination), then the procedure must be 
validated to confirm that the specified cleaning method, chemicals and concentrations are 
capable of consistently achieving the level of performance required. Records of validation 
must be maintained.

When designing and validating cleaning procedures, cleaning chemical residues must 
be considered so that they cannot become a source of product contamination (e.g. 
manufacturer’s instructions must be followed regarding rinse methods). Cleaning checks 
should include hard-to-reach locations as well as surfaces and those locations that are easy 
to reach, effectively confirming satisfactory cleaning of all surfaces and areas.

Where results are outside of the acceptable limits, the site’s procedures should ensure that 
corrective action is taken (e.g. by repeating the cleaning process and rechecking the standard 
of cleaning). The exact action will depend on the type of cleaning, the check methodology 
and the acceptable levels that have been defined.

4.11.4 The resources for undertaking cleaning shall be available. Where it is necessary to dismantle 
equipment for cleaning purposes or to enter large equipment for cleaning, this shall 
be appropriately scheduled and, where necessary, planned for non-production periods. 
Cleaning staff shall be adequately trained or engineering support provided where access 
within equipment is required for cleaning.

Interpretation Training and resources

Appropriate resources are required to ensure that all cleaning is completed correctly and to 
the appropriate standard. These resources will include:

• cleaning equipment
• cleaning chemicals (e.g. detergents)
• trained personnel. (As per the requirements of section 7.1, all cleaning must be carried 

out by trained staff. Training records must demonstrate that the relevant training has been 
completed and must cover all staff involved in cleaning activities, including employment 
agency and temporary staff.)

Where specialist resources or activities are required (e.g. to dismantle or enter large 
equipment), this must be appropriately scheduled and, where necessary, planned for non-
production periods.

Full support must be provided by engineering, either by additional training or by having 
engineering staff present during these cleaning operations.

performance and to instigate improvements where required.

Interpretation Cleaning inspection and sign-off

An authorised member of staff (e.g. line supervisor, quality assurance supervisor or 
production manager) must formally accept equipment back into operation following an 
inspection, to confirm that the cleaning has been completed satisfactorily.

The results of checks on cleaning, including visual or analytical checks, must be recorded. 
These records must be used to identify trends in cleaning performance and to instigate 
improvements where required. For example, trends and potential changes could be 
discussed during management meetings (clause 1.1.4).

Where changes in cleaning regimes are required (e.g. to prevent the build-up of micro-
organisms, biofilm or scale), companies may need access to relevant expertise or advice.

4.11.6 Cleaning equipment shall be:

• hygienically designed and fit for purpose
• suitably identified for intended use (e.g. colour-coded or labelled)
• cleaned and stored in a hygienic manner to prevent contamination.

Interpretation Cleaning equipment

Cleaning equipment, including any equipment or utensils used for cleaning activities, must 
be suitable for the purpose for which it is intended and capable of achieving the desired 
level of cleaning. For example, equipment would not be suitable if it:

• had the potential to shed fibres
• was not hygienically designed (to facilitate easy cleaning after use).

Equipment must be clearly identified at all times (by colour-coding and/or labelling). This is 
necessary to ensure that different types of equipment are clearly distinguishable (e.g. floor-
cleaning equipment must be distinguishable from items designated for cleaning production 
equipment). It must also be stored hygienically and in a manner that prevents contamination 
(e.g. stored in designated locations and not in contact with the floor).

The operation of tray/rack washes to ensure that they operate effectively should also 
be considered; for example, checks could include the visual inspection of cleaned 
trays, monitoring water temperature or the chemical concentration of detergent, or 
microbiological swabbing.

4.11.7 Cleaning in place (CIP)

Interpretation

CIP is a method of cleaning the interior surfaces of pipes, vessels, process equipment, filters and associated fittings 
without disassembly.

There are various designs of CIP system, but they are often categorised as either of the following:



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

178   brcgs.com

• single-use systems – where the CIP rinse solution is used and replaced with fresh solution
• re-use systems – the rinse solution is used and collected so that it can be re-used multiple times.

Additionally, the system may be fully automated or semi-automated.

CIP equipment is specialist, and therefore operator training is important. See section 7.1 for information on training.

Clause Requirements
4.11.7.1 All CIP equipment shall be designed and constructed to ensure effective operation. This 

shall include:

• validation confirming the correct design and operation of the system
• an up-to-date schematic diagram of the layout of the CIP system
• where rinse solutions are recovered and re-used, an assessment of the risk of cross-

contamination (e.g. due to the re-introduction of an allergen or the existence of different 
production risk zones within the site).

Alterations or additions to the CIP system shall be authorised by a suitably competent 
individual before changes are made. A record of changes shall be maintained.

The system shall be revalidated at a frequency based on risk, and following any alteration or 
addition.

Interpretation Effective operation, maintenance and validation of CIP systems

Effective CIP starts with the design (e.g. designed by an approved equipment supplier – see 
section 4.6 for information regarding new equipment) and set-up of the system. The site will 
therefore need validation to confirm that the design, set-up and proposed operation of the 
system are suitable for the intended use. For example:

• knowledge of the layout of the pipework and the position of valves, spray balls and 
holding tanks is essential to ensure that the system will operate consistently and 
effectively and that there are no dead spots or areas where cross-contamination between 
cleaning chemicals and product can occur

• correct design of the CIP system to ensure good coverage of cleaning solutions with 
suitable drainage to avoid pools of solutions; for example, the prevention of shadows 
caused by baffles or spray balls that have been incorrectly located

• assurance that the intended cleaning will be effective (e.g. that the food/products 
intended to be used on the equipment will be effectively removed during cleaning)

• consideration of the risk of potential contaminants (e.g. allergens) from previous products 
being re-introduced onto the equipment during the collection, recycling or re-use of 
solutions (e.g. rinse solutions). Where rinse solutions are recovered and re-used, there 
should be a specific risk assessment to prevent cross-contamination; for example, due to 
allergens or the existence of different production risk zones in the site. See clause 8.5.4 
for the specific requirements for CIP systems operating in multiple production risk zones 
(e.g. high-risk and high-care areas). Confirmation of the correct design and set-up may be 
achieved by an inspection report (e.g. from the equipment manufacturer) or by separate 
documented validation.

A schematic plan or diagram should be provided by the supplier when the system is installed 
and must be updated whenever a change is made, including to software, equipment and 
operation of the system.

Issues are most likely to occur where CIP systems are modified or extended. Therefore, 
controls must be in place to ensure that all changes (e.g. engineering modifications, changes 
to the programming or operation of the system, and changes to consumables such as the 
detergents used) are made only by a suitably trained and competent individual. This could 
be achieved by, for example:

• having a company policy that permits modifications only by the manufacturer of the 
equipment

• training engineering staff
• password-protecting the system with different levels of access to prevent unauthorised 

modifications to programme parameters or software.

Records of changes must be maintained.

The site should use risk assessment to determine suitable intervals for revalidation of 
the CIP system to ensure its continuing effectiveness. The CIP system will also require 
revalidation following any alterations or additions to ensure it continues to operate as 
expected.

4.11.7.2 Limits of acceptable and unacceptable performance for key process parameters shall be 
defined to ensure the removal of target hazards (e.g. soil, allergens, micro-organisms, spores). 
At a minimum these parameters shall include:

• times for each stage
• detergent concentrations
• flow rate and pressure
• temperatures.

These shall be validated and records of the validation maintained.

Interpretation Operation of CIP equipment

The CIP process parameters and tolerances must be identified and limits of acceptable 
and unacceptable performance set, e.g. detergent concentrations and limits on permitted 
carry-over into post-rinse solutions. The actual values of acceptable and unacceptable 
performance will depend on the target hazards that the CIP cleaning is intended to remove 
and this in turn will depend on the product types being processed. Specific hazards may 
include, for example, soil, allergens and/or vegetative micro-organisms.

The Standard identifies minimum key parameters that need to be defined, and their limits 
must be validated to confirm effective removal of the identified hazards.

4.11.7.3 The CIP equipment shall be maintained by suitably trained staff to ensure effective cleaning 
is carried out. This shall include:

• routine checking of detergent concentrations
• monitoring of recovered post-rinse solutions for build-up of carry-over from the detergent 

tanks
• cleaning and inspection of filters, where fitted, at a defined frequency
• storing flexible hoses (where used) hygienically when not in use, and inspecting them at a 

defined frequency to ensure that they are in good condition.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Maintenance of the CIP system

A planned maintenance programme must be in place to ensure all aspects of the CIP system 
are in good working order. At a minimum, this should include:

• monitoring detergent concentrations and post-rinse solutions
• inspection, cleaning and storage of filters and flexible hoses where they are part of the CIP 

system.

The frequency of maintaining the different aspects of the programme should be based on 
risk. For example, good practice normally includes ensuring detergent tanks are drained, 
cleaned and filled, with a log of these activities to confirm that they have been completed to 
schedule.

Monitoring and inspection may be undertaken by trained site staff (e.g. engineers) or carried 
out as part of a service agreement with the supplier or with the service company maintaining 
the system. A report of the inspection (that includes an overview of the scope of the 
inspection, any recommendations for improvement, and confirmation or otherwise of the 
effectiveness of the system) should be kept.

4.11.7.4 CIP facilities, where used, shall be monitored at a defined frequency based on risk. This may 
include:

• monitoring of process parameters defined in clause 4.11.7.2
• ensuring correct connections, piping and settings are in place
• confirming the process is operating correctly (e.g. valves are opening/closing sequentially, 

spray balls are operating correctly)
• ensuring effective completion of the cleaning cycle
• monitoring for effective results, including draining where required.

Procedures shall define the action to be taken if monitoring indicates that processing is 
outside the defined limits.

Interpretation Monitoring of CIP

To ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the CIP system, it is important to routinely 
monitor the operation of the system at a predefined frequency. This will include checks of 
connections, piping and settings prior to starting the cleaning process and a post-cleaning 
confirmation of effective cleaning.

The frequency of monitoring should be based on risk and outlined in the procedures. This 
will include the actions necessary if monitoring indicates a result is outside of the defined 
limits. (Further details on corrective action procedures are in section 3.7).

4.11.8 Environmental monitoring

Risk-based environmental monitoring programmes shall be in place for relevant pathogens or spoilage organisms. 
At a minimum, these shall include all production areas with open and/or ready-to-eat products.

Interpretation

The aim of the environmental monitoring programme is to develop a proactive, preventive monitoring programme 
that will identify and eliminate sources of environmental micro-organisms (e.g. pathogens and spoilage organisms) 
in production and open product areas of the site, and facilitate timely and effective corrective action in the event 
of a risk being identified (i.e. prevent the environmental micro-organisms from becoming the source of product 
contamination which could lead to non-conforming product, a customer complaint or other incidents).

An effective programme can, for example, be used to:

• confirm the effectiveness of cleaning and hygiene activities and identify any areas that require further activity
• prevent product contamination by acting as an ‘early warning’ – identifying potential contamination from the site 

facilities before they affect products.

The design and structure of this programme will depend on the nature of the products being handled and the 
potential hazards associated with them.

The requirements are expected to apply to all sites with:

• open product areas
• ready-to-eat products
• products that are both processed in open product areas and ready-to-eat.

Sites are not expected to ‘opt out’ of this requirement by determining that they have a low-risk product or 
environment; completion of a risk assessment (clause 4.11.8.1) should only be used to identify relevant hazards, 
suitable monitoring techniques and appropriate monitoring frequencies.

There are, however, a small number of products which are inherently safe from these contaminants (e.g. because the 
product’s intrinsic properties do not support the growth or survival of pathogens or spoilage organisms) and there is 
no opportunity for spoilage/pathogen contamination, and therefore an environmental monitoring programme may 
not be required. Where a site believes that this is not required, this belief must have a strong foundation in science 
and not be used to prevent good practices. Therefore it is expected that:

• all sites with high-risk, high-care or ambient high-care operations will have an environmental monitoring 
programme within the relevant open product areas

• environmental monitoring will be applicable to other products, as there have been a number of very high-profile 
food poisoning outbreaks associated with products not conventionally considered as high risk or high care (for 
example, cantaloupe melons, peanut butter, chocolate and milk powder), where environmental monitoring may 
have been effective in identifying an issue early. Similarly, shelf-life issues such as mould contamination of bakery 
products may be reduced by suitable monitoring.

Where a site believes environmental monitoring is not required due to the absence of risk from pathogens and 
spoilage organisms, the site must prove this absence of risk. As a minimum, the site will have a robust risk assessment 
which considers:

• both spoilage organisms and pathogens
• the complete product range at the site.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

182   brcgs.com

Note that this risk assessment must be more than a history of product testing – it must demonstrate an absence of 
risk. Suitable techniques include pathogen modelling, challenge testing and published literature from a reputable 
source demonstrating that pathogens cannot survive or grow.

Examples of products where risk assessment may establish that environmental monitoring is not required include:

• alcoholic beverages and vinegars with a sufficiently high level of alcohol or acid to prevent survival and growth
• salt and sugar in their dry ‘pure’ form
• edible oils with no added ingredients
• fully enclosed production. For example, at a specialist HPP (high-pressure processing) facility, where product is 

received packed, is processed in its packaging and leaves the site in the same packaging
• whole vegetables, sold unwashed.

Auditors will challenge the basis of any risk assessment to make sure this has properly considered likely issues and is 
demonstrably based on robust science.

The requirements for environmental monitoring indicate that the site’s environmental monitoring programme must 
be risk-based, therefore the food safety plan/HACCP may indicate risks that should be monitored. Risks may include 
pathogens and/or spoilage organisms (such as yeasts or moulds), and the site should consider whether it is more 
suitable to monitor the risk directly or via indicator organisms. Well-known examples of pathogens and spoilage 
organisms that may be applicable to a site’s environmental monitoring include:

• Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat products, including those which are chilled and frozen. Alternatively, some 
sites monitor Listeria spp. and only examine the species if adverse positive results are obtained

• Salmonella and/or Enterobacteriaceae in dry environments where susceptible products are handled
• yeasts and/or moulds: these are widespread spoilage organisms which may be of greater relevance for some 

product types. For example, products such as jam are heated to a temperature that will kill many bacterial 
contaminants, are hot-filled, and have a low water activity and low oxygen content. Consequently, the risk of 
pathogen growth is limited. However, there are yeasts and moulds that can cause spoilage in these conditions, and 
therefore manufacturers must ensure that packaging, food contact surfaces and the environment are monitored to 
minimise the risk of contamination.

Clause Requirements
4.11.8.1 The design of the environmental monitoring programme shall be based on risk, and at a 

minimum include:

• sampling procedures
• identification of sample locations
• frequency of tests
• target organism(s) (e.g. pathogens, spoilage organisms and/or indicator organisms)
• test methods (e.g. settle plates, rapid testing and swabs)
• recording and evaluation of results.

The programme and its associated procedures shall be documented.

Interpretation Risk-based environmental monitoring programme

The programme must be based on risk assessment. At a minimum this will include:

• a sampling procedure. It is important to ensure that the sampling method does not 
inadvertently create false positives (e.g. by allowing post-sampling contamination or 
growth of organisms) or false negatives (e.g. by killing organisms in the sample before the 
test is completed). Sampling must be appropriate for the target organisms, test

methods and locations sampled; techniques may include swabs, air sampling, water/liquid 
samples etc. The timing and intended purpose of the sampling are also important; for 
example, cleaning validation, or monitoring of the spread of an organism from a potential 
harbourage area

• identification of suitable test locations, taking into account:
• significance of the area or equipment in terms of the potential to affect food safety; for 

example, food contact surfaces, non-food contact areas which are in close proximity to 
open products, and non-food contact areas some distance away from open products (e.g. 
floors, walls and drains)

• areas or parts of equipment that are difficult to clean and could harbour pathogens
• areas of the site or equipment which previously tested positive
• areas where scientific literature has identified a specific risk (e.g. drains)

• frequency of tests, taking into account:
• products that support the growth of pathogens. These require a greater frequency of 

testing than those that do not support growth
• locations with previous positive results or an upward trend towards an action level 

(clause 4.11.8.2). These are likely to require increased testing to confirm the effectiveness 
of the action taken

• target organisms. These may include specific pathogens that present a risk to the 
product or environment (e.g. Listeria spp in wet environments or Enterobacteriaceae in 
dry environments), specific spoilage organisms (e.g. yeast or mould) or hygiene indicator 
organisms (e.g. total plate count, total coliforms)

• test methods. Rapid on-site and laboratory tests are available, and sites should consider 
the requirements of section 5.6 when deciding which methods and/or laboratories to 
use. Where knowledge is not available on site, the site may need to obtain guidance; for 
example, from an accredited laboratory

• recording and evaluation of results. The significance of the results and any actions 
required must be considered (clause 4.11.8.2)

• reviews of any legal requirements in the country or region (e.g. relating to types of 
products, organisms of concern, or frequency or minimum number of tests). The auditor 
will expect to see the risk assessment and the subsequent plan along with testing 
protocols, procedures and evidence that the site is completing the plan to schedule.

A number of organisations have published guidelines for the development of environmental 
monitoring programmes, including, for example, the Codex Alimentarius ‘Guidelines on the 
application of general principles of food hygiene to the control of Listeria monocytogenes in 
foods’ (CXG 61-2007) – Annex 1.

4.11.8.2 Appropriate control or action limits shall be defined for the environmental monitoring 
programme.

The company shall document the corrective action to be taken when monitored results 
indicate a failure to meet a control limit, or when monitored results indicate an upward trend 
of positive results (i.e. a trend towards a control or action limit).

Interpretation Control or action limits

The site will need to establish appropriate control or action limits and the actions to be 
taken if these are exceeded or when there is a trend towards increasingly positive results. 
The control limits and actions may be based on:

continued

• the organism measured, its level and the location of the positive result
• when the testing was completed (e.g. was the sample taken pre- or post-cleaning?)
• any legal or customer limits.

In addition, many sites have found it useful to:

• identify a warning limit (i.e. a limit at a level which is not an exceedance of an action or 
critical limit, but which allows investigation prior to any exceedance occurring)

• use root cause analysis to establish preventive action (e.g. in the case of recurrence of 
pathogens at a set location).

4.11.8.3 The company shall review the environmental monitoring programme at least annually and 
whenever there are:

• changes in processing conditions, process flow or equipment which could impact the 
environmental monitoring programme

• new developments in scientific information (e.g. new pathogens of concern)
• failures of the programme to identify a significant issue (e.g. regulatory authority tests 

identifying positive results which the site programme did not)
• product failures (products with positive tests)
• consistently negative results (e.g. a site with a long history of negative results should 

review its programme to consider whether the correct parts of the factory are being tested, 
whether the testing is being conducted correctly, whether the tests are for the appropriate 
organisms, etc.).

Interpretation Review of the environmental monitoring programme

The review of the programme could be accomplished as part of the HACCP review or as 
a separate review process. The Standard lists several points which might prompt a review, 
including:

• changes in processing, as these could, for example, affect the ease of cleaning or 
susceptibility of products to contamination and therefore impact the environmental 
monitoring programme. For example, any changes to the cleaning procedures, including 
changes in cleaning frequency, cleaning chemicals or cleaning equipment used, may 
impact the cleanliness of equipment and facilities, and should therefore be considered as 
part of a review of the environmental monitoring procedures

• publication of new scientific information, such as the identification of a micro-organism 
not previously associated with a specific product type, information relating to the survival 
of a pathogen in specific environmental conditions, or any new information on new and 
emerging pathogens

• when independent testing (e.g. by a regulatory authority) identifies positives not previously 
identified by the site’s own tests

• when a positive test on a product implicates the effectiveness of the environmental 
monitoring programme; note that not all product failures indicate a failure in the 
effectiveness of the programme, but the site’s root cause analysis and corrective action 
(see section 3.7) should identify those where the environmental monitoring programme 
should be reviewed.

• In most situations, negative results are seen as good news and lead to an assumption that 
all systems are operating correctly and within permitted parameters. However, if results 
are continuously and consistently negative and there is a long history of negative results, 
this may be indicative that the site should review its programme to consider whether the 
correct locations are being tested, in the correct way, for the correct organisms. The aim of 
the programme is, after all, to identify areas of concern.

4.12 Waste and waste disposal

Waste disposal shall be managed in accordance with legal requirements and to prevent accumulation, risk of 
contamination and the attraction of pests.

Interpretation

Waste disposal systems (for example, in production and storage areas, as well as in waste collection areas or rooms) 
must ensure that the risk of contamination to products is minimised through the control of cross-contamination, 
prevention of unnecessary waste accumulation, and control of pests. Disposal must comply with legal requirements.

Good practice should ensure that containers used for either raw material storage or handling, or for finished 
product storage, are not used for collecting waste. Instead, waste must be collected in appropriate, designated waste 
containers.

Clause Requirements
4.12.1 Where licensing is required by law for the removal of waste, it shall be removed by licensed 

contractors and records of removal shall be maintained and available for audit.

Interpretation Licensing and legislation

Waste contractors must be appropriately licensed and/or approved where this is required by 
local law.

Where legislation exists for specific waste streams (e.g. disposal of meat products), this must 
be complied with; such legislation may include requirements for segregation of waste or 
specific methods of disposal.

Records of removal must be maintained and available for audit.

4.12.2 Internal and external waste collection containers and rooms housing waste facilities shall be 
managed to minimise risk. These shall be:

• clearly identified
• designed for ease of use and effective cleaning
• well maintained to allow cleaning and, where required, disinfection
• emptied at appropriate frequencies.

External waste containers shall be covered or doors kept closed as appropriate.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Waste storage

Waste collection containers and rooms housing waste facilities must be managed to 
minimise the risk of contamination of products. Particular consideration must be given to:

• identification of waste containers and storage areas to ensure waste is collected only in 
designated containers/areas

• ease and effectiveness of cleaning (see section 4.11)
• keeping facilities well maintained
• emptying at appropriate frequencies
• keeping external waste containers covered or room doors closed, thus ensuring that waste 

cannot fall out of containers or stray out of designated rooms to cause a contamination 
risk

• the pest control implications of external waste collection areas.

4.12.3 Waste removal from open product areas shall be managed to ensure that it does not 
compromise product safety.

Interpretation Removal of waste from open product areas

Waste should be removed from open product areas to minimise the risk of product 
contamination (for example, from allergens, pathogens, taint, non-compliance with claims).

A number of considerations may be needed when planning waste handling, including:

• risk assessment – to identify the risks associated with specific products or production 
areas

• process flow – for example, the movement of product, waste and staff
• identification of suitable equipment – for example, are lidded or sealed containers 

needed; are there different types of waste that need to be segregated or handled 
differently?

• scheduling of waste removal – for example, how frequently is waste removed; is removal 
completed during or after the production run?

4.12.4 If unsafe products or substandard trademarked materials are transferred to a third party 
for destruction or disposal, that third party shall be a specialist in secure product or waste 
disposal and shall provide records which include the quantity of waste collected for 
destruction or disposal.

Interpretation Unsafe and trademarked waste

Requirements for the disposal of trademarked waste must be defined within a contract with 
the waste disposal contractor. Records of destruction or disposal must be maintained. The 
objective is to ensure that waste products do not re-enter the food supply chain once sent 
for disposal. If unsafe products are transferred to a third party for destruction, the third party 
must be a specialist in secure product or waste disposal and must provide records which 
include the quantity of waste collected.

4.13 Management of surplus food and products for animal feed

Effective processes shall be in place to ensure the safety and legality of by-products of the primary processing 
activity of the site.

Interpretation

All products intended for the human food chain must not be injurious to health, and must be fit for human 
consumption. Therefore the site’s procedures to control the handling and storage of surplus food and by-products 
must ensure that safety and legality are maintained.

Similarly, by-products or other materials intended for animal feed must meet the relevant requirements for safety 
and legality pertaining to those supply chains.

Clause Requirements
4.13.1 Surplus customer-branded products shall be disposed of in accordance with customer-

specific requirements. Customer brand names shall be removed from packed surplus 
products under the control of the factory before the product enters the supply chain, unless 
otherwise authorised by the customer.

Interpretation Surplus customer-branded products

This clause covers the situation where surplus product is not required by the intended 
customer (e.g. because of a fall in predicted orders), but is still suitable for sale to alternative 
customers. It does not include sales to staff or donations to charity, which are covered 
separately in clause 4.13.2.

The release of surplus product to alternative customers must only take place in accordance 
with the original brand owner’s specific requirements. For example, in many cases the 
product packaging (or associated documentation) will refer to the brand owner and these 
brand names will need to be removed before the product leaves the site.

4.13.2 Where customer-branded products which do not meet specifications are sold to staff or 
passed on to charities or other organisations, this shall be with the prior consent of the 
brand owner.

Processes shall be in place to ensure that all products (own-branded and customer-
branded) which are sold to staff or passed on to charities or other organisations are fit for 
consumption and meet legal requirements, and that their traceability is maintained.

Interpretation Staff shops and donations of products to charity

Many companies sell products to staff or donate them to charity when they are not required 
by the intended customer (e.g. because of a fall in predicted orders, minor cosmetic damage 
to packaging, or failure to meet the brand owner’s specification).

In many cases the product packaging (or associated documentation) will refer to the brand 
owner and therefore release to charity or staff must only take place with the prior consent 
of the brand owner. It is not necessary for the site to obtain this consent for each individual 
batch of product or on each occasion that the product is sent to a charity; however, the 
brand owner’s policy or permission must be defined (e.g. in a policy document or within the 
company’s contract).

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

All products (customer-branded and own brand) must still be safe, be legal (e.g. meet legal 
requirements for labelling), maintain traceability and be fit for consumption; therefore the 
site should have documented procedures which detail the product assessment and release 
process. Staff responsibilities, including which staff have authorisation to release products 
for staff sale or charitable donation, should also be made clear.

4.13.3 By-products and downgraded/surplus products intended for animal feed shall be segregated 
from waste and protected from contamination during storage. Products for animal feed shall 
be managed in accordance with the relevant legislative requirements.

Interpretation Food for animal feed

In many parts of the world, there are specific regulations relating to the suitability of 
products and by-products for inclusion in animal feed (e.g. EU legislation on animal by-
products and the control of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies). It is essential 
that, where products and by-products are supplied for animal feed, the site is aware of, and 
complies with, the relevant legislation. There are several recognised feed schemes and, 
where applicable, certification to such a scheme may be required. The animal feed contractor 
must also be appropriately licensed.

Materials for inclusion in animal feed must be segregated from other waste streams and 
managed to prevent contamination, and should be labelled accordingly.

4.14 Pest management

The whole site shall have an effective preventive pest management programme in place to minimise the risk of 
pest presence, and resources shall be available to respond rapidly to any issues which occur to prevent risk to 
products.

Pest management programmes shall comply with all applicable legislation.

Interpretation

Management of pests must be undertaken at a level commensurate with the needs of the whole site, including 
temporary or seasonal facilities and all storage units, based on the:

• nature of identified potential pests, including rodents, insects and birds
• characteristics of raw materials (regarding their potential for stored insect pests)
• equipment
• finished products
• process
• site and environment (e.g. prevention of ingress and the removal of potential pest harbourage)
• potential for future pest risks
• legal requirements in the country or region where the site is located.

Where instances of pest ingress (i.e. single occasion or low numbers) occur, these need to be appropriately 
investigated and actioned but must not be deemed as loss of control. However, where there is pest presence (i.e. 
evidence of large numbers of pests breeding within the building or site over a period of time), this must be regarded 
as loss of control and a lack of maintenance of the pest management programme, and will lead to a major non-
conformity being awarded.

Clause Requirements
4.14.1 If pest activity is identified, it shall not present a risk of contamination to products, raw 

materials or packaging.

The presence of any infestation on site shall be documented in pest management records 
and be part of an effective pest management programme to eliminate or manage the 
infestation so that it does not present a risk to products, raw materials or packaging.

Interpretation Pests present on site

Where pest activity is identified (for example, during site inspections (clauses 4.14.2 and 
4.14.10) or reported by staff (clause 4.14.12)), actions must be taken to ensure the risk of 
contamination of products, raw materials or packaging is avoided. The site will therefore 
need to record and assess any reported pest activity in a timely manner to ensure 
appropriate action can be taken. This may include action by the site (e.g. isolation of at-risk 
product) or by its approved pest management contractor (clause 4.14.2).

Where an infestation occurs, this must be clearly documented and effectively managed 
(clause 4.14.8).

Any products, raw materials or packaging implicated by pest activity should be subject to the 
site’s non-conforming product processes (see section 3.8).

4.14.2 The site shall either contract the services of a competent pest management organisation or 
have appropriately trained staff for the regular inspection and treatment of the site to deter 
and eradicate infestation.

The frequency of inspections shall be determined by risk assessment and shall be 
documented. The risk assessment shall be reviewed whenever:

• there are changes to the building or production processes which could have an impact on 
the pest management programme

• there has been a significant pest issue.

Where the services of a pest management contractor are employed, the service scope shall 
be clearly defined and reflect the activities of the site.

Service provision, regardless of the source, shall meet with all applicable regulatory 
requirements.

Interpretation Pest management system

There must be regular inspection and, where appropriate, treatment of the site to deter 
and eradicate infestation. The frequency of inspection and treatment of the premises must 
be based on the product risk, including the age, design and location of the buildings and 
equipment.

Pest management is often contracted to external companies, which may need to be licensed 
or approved by local or national authorities. The contractor must demonstrate competence 
(evidence could, for example, include membership of a national trade association, training 
records, licence or CEPA certification to EN 16636 for pest management services). Section 
3.5.3 also applies to the management of the pest management services.

All pest management activity must be in accordance with legislative requirements. For 
example, in some countries you must have a licence to purchase and use certain chemicals 
(e.g. rodenticides in the EU).

The scope of the service must be clearly defined (e.g. in a contract) and should include 
provision for additional treatments where required to eradicate any infestation that may 
occur.

Where pest management is handled in-house, responsible employees must have appropriate 
training, as evidenced by training records (clause 4.14.3).

A review of the system should be made when changes to the site or processes occur, but 
where no changes have been made, an annual review is also good practice. The auditor will 
expect to see that the frequency of inspections is appropriate to the nature of the site, 
and takes into account any infestation or issues with pests which have been highlighted by 
monitoring activity.

Where automated monitoring or inspection is in place, it can affect the frequency of 
inspections (e.g. online monitoring devices can report to the site and contractor, allowing the 
contractor to advise whether a callout or other action is required). It is not a replacement for 
site visits but can lead to more focused visits that are not just bait-point checking.

Pest management services must meet all legal and regulatory requirements of the country 
where the site is located. Consideration may be required if the site exports to countries with 
differing legislative requirements.

4.14.3 Where a site undertakes its own pest management, it shall be able to effectively 
demonstrate that:

• pest management operations are undertaken by trained and competent staff with 
sufficient knowledge to select appropriate pest control chemicals and proofing methods 
and understand the limitations of use, relevant to the biology of the pests associated with 
the site

• staff undertaking pest management activities meet any legal requirements for training or 
registration

• sufficient resources are available to respond to any infestation issues
• there is ready access to specialist technical knowledge when required
• legislation governing the use of pest control products is understood and complied with
• dedicated locked facilities are used for the storage of pesticides.

Interpretation In-house pest management

With regard to the need for pest management to be undertaken by trained staff, the auditor 
will check the appropriate training records for proof of adequate training. Suitable training 
would be expected to cover all relevant activities that the staff member is responsible for, 
including, for example, legislation, pest management techniques, correct use of monitoring 
and control devices, or permitted baits.

Access to specialist technical knowledge can be obtained by engaging the services of an 
external contractor or via trade association membership.

In some geographic regions legislation governing the use of pest control products is 
updated frequently and the appointed staff will need to keep abreast of any changes.

4.14.4 Pest management documentation and records shall be maintained. At a minimum, this shall 
include:

• an up-to-date plan of the full site, identifying pest control devices and their locations
• identification of the baits and/or monitoring devices on site
• clearly defined responsibilities for the site management and the contractor
• details of pest control products used, including instructions for their effective use and 

action to be taken in the event of an emergency
• any observed pest activity
• details of pest control treatments undertaken.

Records may be on paper (hard copy) or controlled on an electronic system (e.g. an online 
reporting system).

Interpretation Pest management documentation and records

Written procedures and inspection documentation must be maintained. These must include:

• an up-to-date site plan identifying the locations of pest monitoring and control devices. 
This plan should be reviewed periodically, for instance annually or when there are site 
changes

• identification (e.g. a numbered list) of the types of bait and monitoring devices on site
• clearly defined responsibilities for site management and the contractor. This should 

include methods of communication, contact details for the nominated site and contractor 
personnel, and dates for when review meetings will take place

• details of the pest control products used and instructions for their safe and effective use
• records of any pest activity observed
• details of pest control activities undertaken.

All pest management inspections must be recorded, even when there are only negative 
findings to report. This is important for due diligence: in the event of an incident, these 
records can confirm when the site or area was last inspected and confirmed as satisfactory, 
and demonstrate this to regulatory authorities and customers. Records can be in any format 
as long as they are accessible by the site. For example, during an audit the auditor may review 
paper-based pest management records or, where records are online, ask the site to access 
the records and demonstrate use of the online system.

4.14.5 Bait stations or other rodent monitoring or control devices shall be appropriately located 
and maintained to prevent contamination risk to product. Toxic rodent baits shall not be 
used within production or storage areas where open product is present except when treating 
an active infestation. Where toxic baits are used, these shall be secured.

Any missing bait stations shall be recorded, reviewed and investigated.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Bait stations

Bait stations and other rodent monitoring or control devices must be appropriately 
designed, located and maintained to limit the potential for contamination of products. This 
can be achieved by:

• making them tamper-resistant
• securing them in place or locating them in positions where accidental movement is 

unlikely
• using non-spill formulations
• inspecting them routinely at a frequency based on risk assessment or local legislation (this 

is particularly important for areas where live catch, break-back traps or spring-powered 
traps are permitted because of the potential for secondary pests, if the caught pests are 
not removed sufficiently quickly).

The pest management specialist should advise on the quantity and siting of the monitoring 
devices; their locations might be risk-based rather than evenly distributed. When an active 
infestation is being treated, the location of additional monitoring or control devices should 
be considered.

Rodent bait is generally toxic, so must be controlled to avoid contamination of product. 
Toxic rodent bait must not be used within production or storage areas where open product 
is present, except when treating an active infestation. Where this occurs, the bait must be 
secured to ensure product cannot be contaminated.

Any missing bait stations or missing rodent control devices should be recorded and 
investigated. Additional action may be required depending on the reason for the absent bait 
station; for example, to ensure that there is no risk to product and that any pest activity has 
been appropriately managed.

4.14.6 Insect-killing devices, pheromone traps and/or other insect-monitoring devices shall be 
appropriately sited and operational. If there is a danger of insects being expelled from a 
fly-killing extermination device and contaminating the product, alternative systems and 
equipment shall be used.

Interpretation Insect-killing devices

Where insect-killing devices, pheromone traps or other insect-monitoring devices are used, 
they must be correctly sited and operational. If insects could be expelled from an insect-
killing device and contaminate the product, alternative systems and equipment must be 
used (e.g. those based on sticky-board technology) or the devices must be moved to a more 
appropriate position.

Equipment must be fully operational. For example, bulbs on insect-killing devices must be 
changed at regular intervals (in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions) to maintain 
optimal luminosity performance (there is no minimum frequency for changing the bulbs, as 
this will depend on a number of factors, including the brand of bulb used), and pheromone 
traps must be replenished quarterly or in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Documentation must provide evidence of this maintenance.

4.14.7 The site shall have adequate measures in place to prevent birds from entering buildings or 
roosting above loading or unloading areas.

Interpretation Birds

The site (or its pest management contractor) should use a risk assessment approach to 
establish whether there is any potential for the ingress of birds, or for roosting and nesting at 
loading or unloading areas, and to assess the measures required to mitigate the risk.

The expectation here is not necessarily to rebuild or reconfigure facilities; instead, the 
intention is to recognise any potential problems and take steps to remove or mitigate these 
risks from birds roosting and nesting.

4.14.8 In the event of infestation, or evidence of pest activity, immediate action shall be taken to 
identify at-risk products and to minimise the risk of product contamination. Any potentially 
affected products should be subject to the non-conforming product procedure.

Interpretation Infestation and evidence of pest activity

In the event of infestation (clause 4.14.1), immediate action must be taken to eliminate the 
hazard. This will include identifying and quarantining any potentially affected product so 
that it can be evaluated in accordance with the site’s non-conforming product procedures.

Action may also include steps to protect other products, and inspection by the pest 
management specialist. Any such infestation and corrective actions taken must be recorded; 
see section 3.8 for the non-conforming product procedure.

4.14.9 Records of pest management inspections, pest proofing and hygiene recommendations and 
actions taken shall be maintained. It shall be the responsibility of the site to ensure that all 
of the relevant recommendations made by its contractor or in-house expert are carried out 
in a timely manner.

Interpretation Records of pest management inspections

Records of pest management will include any recommendations made by the pest 
management specialist (e.g. changes to inspection frequency or pest proofing).

It is the responsibility of the company to ensure that all relevant recommendations made by 
the pest management specialist are carried out within a suitable timescale and verified for 
effectiveness. Records of these changes must be maintained.

4.14.10 An in-depth, documented pest management assessment shall be undertaken at a frequency 
based on risk, but at least annually, by a pest management expert to review the pest 
management measures in place. The assessment shall:

• include an in-depth inspection of the site, equipment and facilities for pest activity
• review the existing pest management measures in place and make any recommendations 

for change.

The assessment shall be timed to allow access to equipment for inspection where a risk of 
stored product insect infestation exists.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Pest management assessment

In-depth pest management assessments are in addition to the regular inspections (e.g. monthly 
checks of bait and traps) conducted as part of the pest management programme (clause 4.14.2).

The aim of these assessments is to:

• ensure an in-depth inspection of the site, equipment and facilities for evidence of pest 
activity and to determine the current levels of pest activity throughout the site. This 
should not be a matter of mere bait checking, but should include an audit of the whole of 
the site, especially in less accessible areas such as voids and cable runs, stores and silos 
(see below), where established pests are less easy to detect

• review existing measures to provide a critical appraisal of the site’s pest management 
activities to ensure they remain appropriate

• where appropriate, liaise with the technician who completes the routine pest management 
activities, to agree changes to the pest management programme

• review pest management-related records
• suggest alternative approaches to resolving problems
• liaise with senior site or group management.

Where insects in stored product represent a potential hazard, the visits should be scheduled 
for a time when access to equipment for inspection purposes is available, so that the 
greatest value can be gained from the survey. Where pest activity is seasonal in nature, the 
survey may be timed to coincide with the period of greatest risk.

The assessment will be completed by a pest management expert (e.g. the pest management 
contractor’s field biologist or a senior technician with a qualification in pest management 
and many years of experience). Many countries have formal qualifications for those working 
in pest management; for example, by operating a legally backed licensing system. Anyone 
working as a field biologist should at least have a recognised basic pest management 
qualification, available in the country concerned, irrespective of whether it is a legal 
requirement. Few countries have formal higher-level pest management qualifications. 
However, a field biologist should be a senior, competent technician with a number of years 
of practical pest management experience. Other desirable qualifications, knowledge and 
skills may include:

• possession of a recognised food safety qualification. Field biologists work closely with 
food, so should be trained to at least the same level as a food-handling employee

• membership of a relevant continuing professional development (CPD) scheme, if such 
a scheme exists in the country of operation. At the very least, they should be able to 
demonstrate that they keep up to date with technical and regulatory developments in pest 
management

• knowledge of the scope and content of the food industry standards the site is working to. 
For example, do they understand the requirements of the Standard and whether the site 
has to meet any customer-specific requirements?

• knowledge and understanding of the food manufacturing processes operating at the site, 
particularly when commodities vulnerable to infestation by stored-product insects are 
being handled or processed

• how to use pest monitoring data to effectively target and measure the success of control 
measures. For example, using monitoring data to generate trend analyses (as opposed to 
just counts) is key.

Interpretation

This highlights an important difference between the in-depth audit and the practical, 
routine pest management service completed by the pest management technician. It is not 
simply a second tier of inspection, adding complexity and costs to the contract. The pest 
management field biologist is on hand to lead the pest management programme, and should 
use the in-depth audit to guide the efforts of both site personnel and the pest management 
technician to eliminate problems and maintain pest-free conditions. In pest management 
terms, the field biologist is the most important person working on behalf of the pest 
management contractor in any food site. It is therefore important that the site is satisfied 
that this expert is fully competent and has sufficient knowledge and experience to conduct 
the audit and produce meaningful results.

Good practice is to separate the in-depth audit and routine inspections, rather than 
complete them at the same time. It is also often useful for the in-depth assessment to be 
conducted by an alternative consultant rather than the staff responsible for the regular 
inspections, as this has the benefit of a second expert examining the site and the current 
pest management programme.

It is expected that the audits will be completed at least annually; however, risk assessment 
may indicate that a different frequency is required (e.g. where pest issues are seasonal in 
nature then the frequency may need to increase). The BRCGS auditor will expect to see the 
risk assessment that the site has used to determine the appropriate frequency. The results of 
the surveys should be incorporated into the company management review (clause 1.1.4).

This clause applies to all sites, not just those carrying out their own pest management.

BRCGS has produced a separate best-practice guideline to pest management which may be 
purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate.

Further guidance In-depth report format and content

The Standard does not prescribe the format of the report, and each pest management 
specialist is likely to have their own preferred format. However, it is the content and not the 
format that is all-important. As a minimum, the report should include:

Areas inspected

The audit report should include reference to the areas inspected, even where no problems 
have been found. A list of issues requiring attention without any additional detail is unlikely 
to provide the depth of information that the site requires to improve. If an area has been 
inspected and found clear, it is important that this is recorded: it is the contractor’s evidence 
that the area has been inspected, and the food manufacturer’s evidence that there are no 
problems there.

Any problems

Problems relating to, for example, sanitation and building fabrication should be highlighted. 
These observations should have as their objective either the eradication of an existing 
infestation, or the prevention of a new one. Where it is not immediately obvious, the reasons 
why the observation points to a problem should also be stated, and practical and appropriate 
recommendations should be made to address these matters.

Current system review

There should be a review of whether the pest management system is suitable; and, if it 
is found to be inadequate or inappropriate, recommendations should be made regarding 
alternative proactive pest management practices and strategies.

Some pest contractors include useful information in addition to the on-site audit; for 
example, a summary of the pest inspections and trend analysis, as discussed in clause 4.14.11. 
This is acceptable; however, note that this information cannot form a substitute for an on-
site visit, or for the audit described above.

4.14.11 Results of pest management inspections shall be assessed and analysed for trends on a 
regular basis. At a minimum, results of inspections shall be analysed:

• annually or
• in the event of an infestation.

The analysis shall include results from trapping and monitoring devices to identify problem 
areas. The analysis shall be used as a basis for improving the pest management procedures.

Interpretation Periodic assessment and trend analysis

There must be a periodic assessment of pest management inspection results and trends. The 
review will consider:

• pest control measures
• bait takes
• analysis from trapping and monitoring devices
• identification of any trends
• action taken
• recommendations for changes or improvement.

At a minimum, this periodic assessment must be conducted annually (or sooner in the event 
of an infestation).

4.14.12 Staff shall understand the signs of pest activity and be aware of the need to report any 
evidence of such activity to a designated manager.

Interpretation Reporting of pest activity

Any member of staff on the site should be trained to recognise pest activity in production or 
storage areas, and this can form part of the site’s induction and refresher training programme. 
The content might address typical pests, different types of evidence of pest activity, and the 
food safety implications. Subsequently, any pest activity witnessed by any member of staff 
needs to be reported to the designated person.

The identification of the designated person and the process by which information should 
be reported also need to be communicated to the staff. The designated person will need to 
record the evidence and assess whether additional action is required.

4.15 Storage facilities

All facilities used for the storage of raw materials, packaging, in-process products and finished products shall be 
suitable for purpose.

Interpretation

The site’s procedures for storage must be controlled to ensure they do not pose a risk to products. This includes all 
raw materials and packaging, intermediates and finished products. Storage facilities must be suitable for all products 
stored and take into consideration the requirements for specific products; for example:

• the temperature at which the product must be stored
• allergen management
• segregation, where required; for example, food and non-food storage.

Clause Requirements
4.15.1 Procedures to maintain product safety and quality during storage shall be developed on the 

basis of risk assessment, understood by relevant staff and implemented accordingly. These 
may include, as appropriate:

• managing chilled and frozen product transfer between temperature-controlled areas
• segregation of products where necessary to avoid cross-contamination (physical, 

microbiological or allergens) or taint uptake
• storing materials off the floor and away from walls
• specific handling or stacking requirements to prevent product damage.

Interpretation Documented storage procedures

The company must consider the potential risks to product safety and quality that may 
develop during storage. For example, if a product is temperature-controlled, the specified 
temperature must be maintained throughout the storage of the product.

In addition to the points listed in the requirement, the company should also maintain the 
cleanliness of the storage areas (e.g. with appropriate cleaning procedures and identified 
frequencies, as evidenced by documented records), in accordance with the requirements in 
section 4.11.

4.15.2 Where appropriate, packaging shall be stored away from other raw materials and finished 
product. Any part-used packaging materials suitable for use shall be effectively protected 
from contamination and clearly identified to maintain traceability before being returned to 
an appropriate storage area.

Interpretation Storage of packaging

In order to avoid product contamination risks from packaging (such as glass) or 
contamination of unused packaging by-products, packaging should be stored away from 
raw materials and finished product. This may be achieved by use of a dedicated packaging 
store or a dedicated area of a raw material store. Only packaging required for immediate use 
should be stored in the actual packing area (clause 6.2.1).

The storage of packaging outside is acceptable only where the packaging material:



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

• is not at risk of deterioration (e.g. rusting of cans)
• is protected from contamination
• is cleaned effectively before filling.

Once packing has finished, controls must be in place to ensure that any leftover packaging 
is still suitable for use before its return to storage (e.g. it has not been contaminated or 
printed with code information preventing reuse). Any open containers must be appropriately 
resealed or rewrapped and returned to appropriate storage to minimise the potential for 
contamination (such as splashing during cleaning operations) or mis-packs. The traceability 
of packaging should be retained (i.e. the coding is retained on the outer packs on return to 
storage).

4.15.3 Where temperature control is required (e.g. for raw materials, semi-finished materials or 
final products), the storage area shall be capable of maintaining product temperature within 
specification and operated to ensure specified temperatures are maintained. Temperature 
recording equipment with suitable temperature alarms shall be fitted to all storage facilities 
or there shall be a system of recorded manual temperature checks, typically on at least a 
4-hourly basis or at a frequency which allows for intervention before product temperatures 
exceed defined limits for the safety, legality or quality of products.

Interpretation Temperature control

Where temperature control is required for the appropriate storage of products, the storage 
area must be capable of maintaining the required temperature. Good practice is for doors to 
close automatically or be alarmed to ensure they cannot be inadvertently left open.

Temperature management is usually carried out through the use of automatic temperature 
recording systems, which raise an alarm when temperatures fall outside a set range for a 
defined period (to allow for the usual defrost cycles). The alarm must be capable of notifying 
a responsible person outside of normal working hours, either by notification to on-site 
security, by a home call or by ringing through to a service centre.

Where such automatic systems are not in use, the same level of safeguard to product 
temperature control needs to be instigated through manual temperature checks. To achieve 
a similar level of control, manual temperature checks should be carried out on a 4-hourly 
basis, including during nights and weekends. The frequency of checks could be reduced 
where the nature of the product and the insulating capability of the unit are such that the 
product would remain unaffected by a refrigeration failure of longer than 4 hours (e.g. some 
frozen products). Ongoing temperature records must demonstrate that product temperature 
requirements are being met.

Procedures must specify the frequency of manual checks or the use of automatic continual 
monitoring systems. All temperature monitoring must allow intervention before product 
temperatures exceed defined limits for the safety, legality or quality of products. Procedures 
should therefore identify the action to be taken in the event that:

• temperature monitoring indicates temperatures outside of the permitted levels
• there is a failure of the temperature control systems (e.g. a breakdown of the chiller or 

freezer).

In regions where ambient temperatures may fluctuate considerably (e.g. large seasonal 
differences, or considerable variation from day to day), the site should be aware that this may 
have an adverse effect on ambient storage as well as chilled and frozen facilities. Depending 
on the product type, the site may need to consider emergency contingency monitoring or 
control to ensure product safety or quality.

4.15.4 Where controlled atmosphere storage is required, the storage conditions shall be specified 
and effectively controlled. Records shall be maintained of the storage conditions.

Interpretation Storage in controlled atmosphere

Where storage conditions include other parameters (e.g. modified atmosphere storage of 
fruit and vegetables), the mix of gases needs to be defined and monitored to ensure the 
quality of the product is maintained.

Tests are required to ensure that the correct composition of gases is present. They are 
different from the tests identified in clause 4.5.3, which relate to contamination and food 
safety. Test results must be recorded.

4.15.5 Where storage outside is necessary, items shall be protected from contamination and 
deterioration. Items shall be checked for suitability before being brought into the factory.

Interpretation Storage outside

Where it is necessary to store product and equipment outside, they must be protected from 
pests and the elements. Therefore storage of products and equipment outside is normally 
appropriate only where the site can demonstrate that the material:

• is not at risk of deterioration
• is protected from contamination
• is cleaned effectively before being brought into the factory.

Particular attention must be paid to cleaning and inspection of the materials before they are 
brought into the factory and used, to prevent contamination.

4.15.6 The site shall facilitate correct stock rotation of raw materials, intermediate products and 
finished products in storage and ensure that materials are used in the correct order in 
relation to their manufacturing date and within the prescribed shelf life.

Interpretation Stock rotation

Stock, whether raw materials, intermediates (including rework) or finished products, must be 
controlled to ensure that materials are used in an appropriate order and do not exceed their 
shelf life. This control is generally operated on a ‘first in, first out’ basis.

Product identification, such as labelling, and inventory systems can help to facilitate the 
correct order in relation to the materials’ manufacturing dates and prescribed shelf life.

The site’s procedures for dispatch and transport must be controlled to ensure they do not pose a risk to final 
products.

Where transport or distribution is subcontracted, the requirements for suppliers of services also apply (see 
section 3.5.3).

Clause Requirements
4.16.1 Procedures to maintain product safety and quality during loading and transportation shall be 

developed and implemented. These may include, as appropriate:

• controlling temperature of loading dock areas and vehicles
• the use of covered bays for vehicle loading or unloading
• securing loads on pallets to prevent movement during transit
• inspection of loads prior to dispatch.

Interpretation Dispatch and transport procedures

The site must consider the potential risks to product safety and quality that may develop 
during dispatch and transport. In addition to the points listed in the requirement, vehicles 
should also be inspected prior to loading and unloading (clause 4.16.2).

4.16.2 All vehicles or containers used for the transport of raw materials and the dispatch of 
products shall be fit for purpose. This shall ensure that they are:

• in a clean condition
• free from strong odours which may cause taint to products
• in a suitable condition to prevent damage to products during transit
• equipped to ensure any temperature requirements can be maintained throughout 

transportation.

Records of inspections shall be maintained.

Interpretation Vehicle inspection

Inspection of vehicles should be a site’s responsibility even where the vehicles and 
distribution are subcontracted. At a minimum, the inspection will cover whether vehicles 
have the correct levels of cleanliness and are free from evidence of pests and strong odours 
(which could taint a product), and have been maintained to prevent product damage during 
transit.

The site should ensure that the correct operating temperatures are capable of being 
maintained throughout transportation (i.e. that the refrigeration temperature ranges remain 
within the permitted parameters). This may include pre-cooling trailers for temperature-
sensitive products prior to loading, to maintain correct temperatures.

Vehicle inspection records must be maintained.

Clause Requirements
4.16.3 Where temperature control is required, the transport shall be capable of maintaining 

product temperature within specification, under minimum and maximum load. Temperature 
data-logging devices which can be interrogated to confirm time/temperature conditions, 
or a system to monitor and record at predetermined frequencies the correct operation of 
refrigeration equipment, shall be used and records maintained.

Interpretation Vehicle temperature control

Vehicles that are temperature-controlled must demonstrate the control of temperature 
under both minimum and maximum loads. This can be achieved through the use of 
temperature recorders, data loggers or manual recorded checks. Where manual checks are 
used, the frequency of checking must ensure that the safety and quality of the product 
are maintained. The use of data loggers may be considered as a monitoring method; data 
received should be analysed to ensure that the temperature of products transported is 
maintained.

4.16.4 Maintenance systems and documented cleaning procedures shall be available for all 
vehicles and equipment used for loading/unloading. There shall be records of the measures 
taken.

Interpretation Vehicle maintenance and hygiene

Documented hygiene and maintenance procedures for all vehicles (e.g. forklift trucks, pallet 
trucks) and equipment (e.g. loading hoses for silos) must be in place. They must include:

• the method(s) of cleaning
• the frequency at which the cleaning must be completed
• records that the cleaning has been completed.

4.16.5 The company shall have procedures for the transport of products, which shall include:

• any restrictions on the use of mixed loads
• requirements for the security of products during transit, particularly when vehicles are 

parked and unattended
• clear instructions in the event of vehicle breakdown, accident or failure of refrigeration 

systems, which ensure that the safety of the products is assessed and records maintained.

Interpretation Transport procedures

The site must have procedures for the transport of products. The procedures must include:

• the identification of any restrictions for mixed loads (e.g. specifying where allergen-free 
materials are to be stored or transported) to avoid cross-contamination or taint uptake

• the security of all finished products in transport to ensure that they cannot be 
contaminated, either accidentally or deliberately. This may include tamper-evident 
packing, vehicle seals or contractual handling arrangements with transport providers (such 
as not leaving vehicles unattended in insecure situations)

• breakdown procedures for temperature-controlled vehicles (in case of, for example, 
vehicle breakdown or failure of the refrigeration system). These should consider:
• facilities for vehicle drivers to easily contact the company or haulier for assistance
• provision of a backup vehicle or rapid-repair facility
• guidelines to evaluate the acceptability of product affected by the breakdown.

The appropriate staff must be trained in these procedures.

4.16.6 Where the company uses contractors, it shall have a documented supplier approval 
procedure to ensure risks to food quality and safety are effectively managed during dispatch 
and transport operations. The approval procedure shall be based on risk and include either 
one or a combination of:

• a valid certification to the applicable BRCGS Standard (e.g. Global Standard Storage and 
Distribution) or GFSI-benchmarked standard

or
• a completed contract or terms and conditions. At a minimum, this shall include all the 

requirements of clauses 4.16.1 to 4.16.5. This shall have been reviewed and verified by a 
demonstrably competent person.

Interpretation Transport and dispatch contractors

Where the company uses third-party contractors for transport of products, it must have a 
documented supplier approval procedure to ensure food safety and quality of products 
during these activities. As a minimum, the approval procedure will include either:

• certification to a BRCGS Standard (e.g. Global Standard Storage and Distribution) or 
standard benchmarked by GFSI

or
• a contract with terms and conditions, verified and reviewed by a competent person. As a 

minimum, this contract must include terms and conditions to meet all the requirements of 
clauses 4.16.1 to 4.16.5.

The use of a contract or terms and conditions for defining the requirements may also be an 
option where other forms of transport are used (e.g. couriers or larger-scale carriage such as 
rail transport).

The requirements in section 3.5.3 relating to suppliers of services also apply to dispatch and 
transport contractors.

5.1 Product design/development

Product design and development procedures shall be in place for new products or processes and any changes to 
product, packaging or manufacturing processes to ensure that safe and legal products are produced.

Interpretation

Procedures must be in place to ensure that all new product development and amendments to existing products 
result in safe products.

New product development or the introduction of new ingredients must not compromise existing activities or 
products handled in the same area; for example, the introduction of an allergen or microbiological risk that does not 
already exist in the area would need to be risk-assessed and managed to prevent contamination of existing products.

Clause Requirements
5.1.1 The company shall have a procedure for new product development and changes to existing 

product, packaging and manufacturing processes.

This procedure shall include any restrictions to the scope of new product development to 
control the introduction of hazards which would be unacceptable to the site or customers 
(e.g. the introduction of allergens, glass packaging, microbiological risks or the introduction 
of ingredients that may affect product claims).

Interpretation New product development

The aim of this clause is to formalise processes for new product development, and changes 
to existing products, processes and packaging, to ensure the design, development and 
introduction into production areas does not adversely affect the safety and legality of either 
the existing products manufactured on site or the new products themselves.

Therefore the company must have a new product development procedure which ensures 
that product development activities are aligned with other site policies on the types of 
product or hazards handled on site, to prevent the unintended introduction of these hazards 
– for example, where a company has an existing policy to exclude a particular allergen from 
the site, or where an existing product claim will be adversely affected.

This requirement must operate in conjunction with the food safety plan (HACCP processes); 
for example, see clause 5.1.2 and section 2.12.

Any such restrictions must be documented. Where no restrictions apply, this need not be 
documented.

5.1.2 All new products and changes to product formulation, packaging or methods of processing 
shall be formally approved by the HACCP team leader or an authorised HACCP team 
member. This shall ensure that hazards have been assessed and suitable controls, identified 
through the HACCP system, are implemented. This approval shall be granted before 
products are introduced into the factory environment.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Approval of HACCP for new products

It is important that the site understands the product safety rationale for all new products 
(i.e. the criteria that make a product safe for consumption). This may, for example, include 
processing conditions such as cooking or temperature control; intrinsic properties of 
the product such as pH or water activity; control of shelf life; or the effect of specific 
ingredients such as preservatives.

Experience has shown that sometimes even minor changes to ingredients, packaging or 
processing conditions can have a significant effect on the safety of products. The sign-off of 
changes by the HACCP team leader or an authorised HACCP team member is designed to 
ensure that the consequences of any change are understood. Therefore a full description of 
each proposed change to a product, raw material or process must be made available to the 
HACCP team. This can be demonstrated by a record of the sign-off of product changes (e.g. 
a change authorisation form).

Records should be available even where the change does not result in any modification to 
the existing HACCP or food safety plan.

The assessment of any potential impact on product safety and subsequent sign-off must 
occur before the products are introduced into the factory; i.e. sign-off must be completed 
before production trials begin to ensure that new risks (e.g. from allergens) are not 
introduced into the factory without suitable controls approved by the HACCP team.

5.1.3 Trials using production equipment shall be carried out where it is necessary to validate that 
product formulation and manufacturing processes are capable of producing a safe product 
of the required quality.

Interpretation Production trials

Documented evidence of production trials (i.e. not kitchen-scale trials) need to be available, 
together with test results validating that the product formulation and manufacturing 
processes are capable of producing a safe product of the desired quality.

Production trials may not be required where new products are very closely based on existing 
products. Where production trials are not undertaken, the reason must be documented.

5.1.4 Initial shelf-life trials shall be undertaken using documented protocols that reflect 
conditions expected during manufacture, storage, transport/distribution, use and handling to 
determine product shelf life.

Results shall be recorded and retained and shall confirm compliance with the relevant 
microbiological, chemical and organoleptic criteria or sensory analysis. Where shelf-
life trials prior to production are impractical, for instance for some long-life products, a 
documented science-based justification for the assigned shelf life shall be produced.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Initial shelf-life evaluation

Incorrect product shelf life can result in serious food safety or quality consequences, 
unnecessary waste and production costs. For example:

• an incorrect shelf life that is too long could result in:
• the growth of pathogens to unacceptable levels
• product spoilage

• an incorrect shelf life that is too short can result in:
• unnecessary waste, as unused product will be disposed of (either in the supply chain or 

by the consumer) before it actually needs to be
• increased manufacturing costs (e.g. more frequent production or smaller batch size).

It is therefore important to assign shelf life in a systematic and scientific way. The company 
must establish a documented procedure detailing how initial shelf-life trials are undertaken 
for new products and changes to existing products. This procedure must consider the 
handling conditions throughout the supply chain (e.g. chilled products are often subject 
to 2 hours at an ambient temperature mid-life to mimic the conditions during retail 
shopping). The aim of shelf-life trials is to confirm that product safety, legality and quality are 
acceptable throughout the expected shelf life.

Samples to determine the shelf life should be taken from the trials detailed in clause 5.1.3. 
Where long-shelf-life products (e.g. some canned or frozen products) are developed, it may 
not be possible to complete full shelf-life trials. The justification for the declared shelf life 
must be documented and based on experience from similar products and science-based 
evidence.

Where rework is used or work in progress is stored, shelf life of the material should be 
established to ensure it is used within the correct period.

Ongoing verification of shelf life is covered separately in clause 5.6.3.

5.2 Product labelling

Product labelling shall comply with the appropriate legal requirements and contain information to enable the safe 
handling, display, storage and preparation of the product within the food supply chain or by the customer.

Interpretation

Errors in product labelling remain a significant cause of product recalls. Site processes must therefore have robust 
processes, capable of consistently developing accurate and legal labels.

The labelling of products must meet all of the legal requirements for the designated country of use. The site must 
therefore have processes to ensure it remains up to date with labelling requirements in that country (or countries) 
and that these requirements are accurately transferred onto the packaging and labels.

For the purposes of the Standard, the following definitions apply:

• label – any tag, mark, picture or other descriptive matter, whether it is written, printed or otherwise marked, on or 
attached to the packaging of the product

• labelling – any words, picture or symbol relating to the food and placed on any packaging or label accompanying 
the product.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

206   brcgs.com

Note that activities relating to labelling and packing are located in several sections of the Standard. An effective 
system of label design and packing of products will therefore require these sections to interact and operate together 
within the company. For example:

• Section 5.1 – product design and development
• Section 5.2 – design of labelling
• Section 5.5 – design and purchase of packaging
• Section 6.2 – labelling and packing processes (i.e. packing products and applying labels to products).

Clause Requirements
5.2.1 All products shall be labelled to meet legal requirements for the designated country of use 

and shall include information to allow the safe handling, display, storage, preparation and use 
of the product within the food supply chain or by the customer.

There shall be a process to verify that ingredient and allergen labelling is correct based on 
the product recipe and ingredient specifications.

The company shall have a procedure for artwork approval and sign-off.

Interpretation Legality of labels

The site’s procedures must include the completion of a legality check and sign-off of 
the proofs (or draft designs) of new labels to ensure their compliance; this will include 
verification of ingredient and allergen information, based on both the product recipe 
and ingredient specifications. The appropriate legislative requirements in the country (or 
countries) in which the products will be used must be considered.

Where the company is manufacturing customer-branded products, the customer or brand 
owner will normally have specific policies for the completion of the final artwork; for 
example, the site may need to seek formal agreement of the finished product artwork. Where 
artwork is not formally agreed, the company shall be able to demonstrate that it has taken 
steps to complete the artwork in accordance with the brand owner’s policies.

Where the company is the brand owner, sign-off may be undertaken by an experienced and 
authorised manager or staff member.

During the vertical audit, the auditor will assess the site’s processes for ensuring the 
accuracy of labelling and verify that the systems are operating correctly. The auditor will 
not check every aspect of the labelling to confirm its legality, nor validate the label, but will 
select samples of on-pack information for the site to substantiate and demonstrate the 
robustness of procedures and compliance with this clause. For example:

• for a product which claims ‘10% meat’, the auditor may ask for the evidence that 
demonstrates this claim. This may include the product recipe, the mass balance exercise 
for the specific batch, etc.

• for a product which claims to be a ‘product of the UK’, demonstration of the accuracy of 
the claim could include evidence of the origin of the materials purchased from suppliers

• the auditor may compare the on-pack ingredient information with the recipe and 
specification.

Clause Requirements
5.2.2 There shall be effective processes in place to ensure that labelling information is reviewed 

whenever changes occur to:

• the product recipe
• raw materials
• the supplier of raw materials
• the country of origin of raw materials
• legislation.

Interpretation Label review

The accuracy of product labelling is of primary importance for the legality, consumer safety 
and the maintenance of product authenticity. It is therefore important that whenever a 
change occurs to the product, its formulation or the ingredients, there is a review of the 
label information to ensure it remains correct and up to date. Where it is not, this must lead 
to a change in the labelling. Reviews, for example, will be required when there are changes to 
the:

• product recipe (e.g. reformulation of an existing product)
• composition of the raw materials. For example, when the recipe of a bought-in compound 

raw material changes, good practice is for the supplier to notify the site of the proposed 
change before it actually occurs. This should be documented in the supplier approval 
process (section 3.5)

• supply chain (e.g. the introduction of new suppliers of raw materials)
• country of origin of the product or ingredients
• legislation (in the country/ies in which the product is manufactured and sold).

5.2.3 Where the label information is the responsibility of a customer or a nominated second or 
third party, the company shall provide information:

• to enable the label to be accurately created
• whenever a change occurs which may affect the label information.

Interpretation Second- or third-party label design

This clause is applicable wherever the decision on pack copy is not controlled by the 
company but is the responsibility of the customer or a nominated second or third party.

In these circumstances, the site is responsible for supplying accurate and reliable 
information on which to base the label creation. A system must therefore be in place to 
transfer all the relevant initial information to the relevant customer or nominated party and 
for ensuring that any changes are communicated in a timely manner.

Clause 5.2.1 also applies where the customer or a nominated second or third party completes 
this activity, and therefore there is an expectation that artwork approval and sign-off will be 
completed.

5.2.4 Where cooking instructions are provided to ensure product safety, they shall be fully 
validated to ensure that, when the product is cooked according to the instructions, a safe, 
ready-to-eat product is consistently produced.



FOOD SAFETY
ISSUE 9
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Cooking instructions

This clause is concerned with cooking instructions that are required to make a product safe 
to eat when cooked (e.g. products containing raw chicken), and applies to both own-brand 
and customer-branded products. The site must validate that the cooking instructions will 
result in a product that is consistently safe to eat when the instructions are followed. Sites 
should also consider the potential for instructions to be deviated from.

Where the cooking instructions are completed by a third party, the site is still responsible 
for demonstrating that validation is in place. This may be done by completing the validation 
itself, by management of the service provider (section 3.5.3) or by having the information 
available (e.g. a copy of the validation report from the third party). If the site is using cooking 
instructions in connection with products assessed as high risk or high care, it should refer to 
Appendix 2 of the Standard.

The Standard is not prescriptive on the cooking methods that must be used, as this will 
be dependent on the product type. However, the site should consider any limitations or 
challenges in completing the validation for the chosen cooking method(s). For example, 
microwave ovens provide some additional challenges for the validation of cooking 
instructions. To ensure validation of microwave cooking instructions (ready to heat/cook), 
their power and efficiency must be considered.

5.3 Management of allergens

Pet food and animal feed manufacturers certificated to the Standard are required to meet the appropriate allergen 
management legislation in the country of intended sale of the products. Therefore, if there is no legislation relating 
to allergens in pet food/animal feed, this section of the Standard may be considered ‘not applicable’ for pet food or 
animal feed destined for those countries.

In some parts of the world, allergen claims (e g. gluten- or dairy-free) are made on pet food or animal feed products. 
Therefore, where a site makes an allergen claim on a pet food or animal feed, it is required to meet all of the 
requirements within section 5.3.

Fundamental
The site shall have a system for the management of allergenic materials which minimises the risk of 
allergen contamination (cross-contact) of products and meets legal requirements for labelling in the 
country of sale.

Interpretation

Legislation in many countries requires that the presence of food allergens, when deliberately present in a product, 
must be declared on the pack.

It is important to note that the substances recognised as allergens differ from country to country, and at a minimum 
the company will need to consider the allergens identified as appropriate to its own business, applicable legislation 
(in both the country in which its products are manufactured and the intended country of sale) and customer 
requirements.

There are a number of organisations that provide useful information on allergens and allergen legislation; for 
example, the Food Allergy Research and Resource Programme (FARRP) provides a table of allergens by country, 
available on its Food Allergens – International Regulatory Chart web page. Leaving aside the deliberate use of

allergenic ingredients in a food, there are occasions when a product can be cross-contaminated (cross-contact) 
because of the supply chain or manufacturing environments. Where there is a genuine risk of cross-contamination 
(cross-contact) with an allergen, this must be managed by implementing effective allergen management procedures 
to prevent or minimise (to an acceptable level) both its likelihood and the levels of allergen that are likely to be 
present.

The specific legislative requirements in the geographic origin of the raw material, in the country of manufacture and 
in the country of sale must be considered. This is necessary to ensure that all the relevant allergens are managed and 
none is inadvertently omitted because of differences in the legislation. For example, the list of substances that are 
considered to be allergenic is different in Europe, the US, Australia and Japan.

Where products are both produced and sold in countries where there are no legal requirements for the labelling 
of allergens, the list of allergens as defined in the Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods 
(Codex Stan 1-1985, paragraph 4.2.1.4) should be used as the basis for assessing compliance with the Standard.

Research is continuing to be conducted in a number of countries, including the UK and Australia, to identify allergen 
thresholds (i.e. the minimum amount of an allergen that will cause a reaction in the majority of allergic customers). 
Some of this research has now outlined allergen thresholds for a number of allergens, with the aim of assisting in 
the more appropriate application of precautionary allergen labelling. However, this information must only be used 
following a meaningful risk assessment applied to a well-managed operation. The values are very low (e.g. a few 
milligrams), therefore factories must continue to use the full range of risk assessment, risk management and risk 
communication tools to ensure they produce products that are safe for allergic consumers.

BRCGS publishes a separate guideline on allergen management, which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or 
viewed online at BRCGS Participate.

Clause Requirements
5.3.1 The site shall carry out an assessment of raw materials to establish the presence and 

likelihood of contamination (cross-contact) by allergens. This shall include a review of the 
raw material specifications and, where required, the acquisition of additional information 
from suppliers (e.g. through questionnaires to understand the allergen profile of the raw 
material, its ingredients and the factory in which it is produced).

Interpretation Raw material assessment

Raw materials are a potential source of allergens and of cross-contamination. Therefore, the 
supplier approval and raw material risk assessment procedures (section 3.5.1) must include 
an assessment of raw materials for the presence of allergens and the potential for cross-
contamination.

Raw material specifications (including flavourings, additives, carriers and processing aids) 
must be agreed with each raw material supplier and include the allergen status (both content 
and risk of cross-contamination) of the materials.

Where required, additional allergen information must be obtained (e.g. through the use of 
supplier questionnaires or audits).

Where a compound raw material (i.e. one manufactured from a number of ingredients) is 
purchased, the risk assessment must consider the risks associated with the raw material, its 
ingredients and the manufacturing sites of the ingredients. The assessment process and the 
outcome of the assessment must be documented.

Interpretation 
continued

It is good practice for allergen risk assessments to be reviewed, as part of the review 
processes for the food safety plan (e.g. see clause 2.12.3); for example, when there is a 
change in raw materials or the supply chain.

5.3.2 The company shall identify and list allergen-containing materials handled on site. This shall 
include raw materials, processing aids, intermediate and finished products, and any new 
product development ingredients or products.

Interpretation List of allergenic materials

The aim of this clause is to ensure that the site maintains up-to-date knowledge of the 
allergens that are handled on the site. It is therefore important that the allergen statuses 
of all raw materials, additives, processing aids, intermediates and final products are 
known, in terms of both the deliberate presence of allergens and the potential for cross-
contamination.

All materials that contain allergenic substances (ingredients, processing aids, intermediates 
and finished products) must be listed in a single reference document or database. It is not a 
requirement for this list to be a separate document just for allergen information. Provided 
that all the relevant information is available in a timely fashion (for example, if an allergen 
list can be pulled from the company’s raw material database and clearly identifies which 
allergens are used on site, in which raw materials or finished product), this list or database 
would fulfil the requirements of this clause. This might also include non-food materials used 
in production areas (e.g. pest control baits that are wheat-based).

The need to maintain an up-to-date list should be communicated to all areas of the 
company that can introduce new allergens onto the site or is responsible for allergen risk 
assessment (e.g. the HACCP team, new product development or engineering).

5.3.3 A documented risk assessment shall be carried out to identify routes of contamination 
(cross-contact) and establish documented policies, and procedures for handling raw 
materials and intermediate and finished products, to ensure cross-contamination (cross-
contact) is avoided. This assessment shall include:

• consideration of the physical state of the allergenic material (e.g. powder, liquid, 
particulate)

• identification of potential points of cross-contamination (cross-contact) through the 
process flow

• assessment of the risk of allergen cross-contamination (cross-contact) at each process 
step

• identification of suitable controls to reduce or eliminate the risk of cross-contamination 
(cross-contact).

Interpretation Risk assessment for cross-contamination (cross-contact)

A risk assessment process must be completed to identify potential routes of cross-
contamination (cross-contact). Consideration must be given to

• the physical state of the allergen. For example:
• powdered ingredients represent a greater risk of aerial cross-contamination than those 

in liquid form
• sticky or fatty ingredients are likely to adhere to surfaces should cleaning be ineffective

(ingredients, intermediates or products) can occur. (The map should consider process flow, 
environmental factors, production activities, shared equipment and people.)

• an assessment of the risk at each stage identified in the previous step
• the identification and implementation of all reasonable controls to reduce or eliminate 

cross-contamination (e.g. segregation, the use of dedicated lines or equipment, enhanced 
cleaning schedules).

The risk assessment process, the assessments and any resulting procedures and/or factory 
controls must be documented.

5.3.4 Procedures shall be established to ensure the effective management of allergenic materials 
to prevent cross-contamination (cross-contact) of products not containing the allergen. 
These shall include, as appropriate:

• physical or time segregation while allergen-containing materials are being stored, 
processed or packed

• the use of separate or additional protective overclothing when handling allergenic 
materials

• use of identified, dedicated equipment and utensils for processing
• scheduling of production to reduce changes between products containing an allergen and 

products not containing the allergen
• systems to restrict the movement of airborne dust containing allergenic material
• waste handling and spillage controls
• restrictions on food brought onto site by staff, visitors and contractors and for catering 

purposes.

Interpretation Cross-contamination (cross-contact) procedures

The risk assessment (clause 5.3.3) must be used to develop the factory controls and 
procedures for handling raw materials, intermediates and finished products to reduce (and, 
where possible, remove) the risk of allergen cross-contact. All allergens present on site 
must be considered so that procedures can be designed to prevent allergen cross-contact 
with each specific allergen. For example, contaminating an allergen-containing product with 
another allergen-containing product (such as contaminating a nut-containing product with 
a milk-containing product) is just as significant as contaminating a product with no allergens 
with that allergen.

Effective allergen management procedures must be implemented even where on-pack 
warning labels (clause 5.3.6) are used. Particular attention should be given to:

• physical segregation. Ideally, allergenic ingredients and products will be totally segregated 
from non-allergenic ingredients and products. This could involve, for example, dedicated 
storage areas, dedicated (and colour-coded) production equipment, and the use of 
dedicated production lines

continued

• time segregation. Where products must be handled in the same factory areas or on the 
same production lines, consideration should be given to the use of time segregation. For 
example, all non-allergenic products could be produced first and allergenic materials 
introduced subsequently, or the use of allergenic materials could be confined to the end 
of a day/shift and only before a full clean. Production scheduling could also be used to 
minimise the frequency of changeovers between allergen-containing and non-allergen-
containing products. For example, in some factories it is possible to limit the use of nuts 
to a defined period or shift, rather than producing nut-containing products throughout the 
week

• the potential for protective clothing to be a source of allergen contamination. The use of 
separate clothing or overalls for handling allergenic materials should be considered. It is 
normally useful to colour-code protective clothing to prevent confusion

• the use of dedicated equipment or utensils. These should be clearly identifiable (e.g. by 
colour-coding)

• allergens that can form fine powders (e.g. flour, milk powder and soya isolates). The 
movement of airborne dust should be minimised by, for example, using physical barriers 
(such as shrouds, lids or segregated areas) for dispensing and mixing operations. The 
location of air-conditioning outlets or the use of fans should also be considered to ensure 
these do not distribute airborne allergens

• waste handling and spillage controls. Allergens should be removed efficiently, ensuring 
that the removal process does not become the source of allergen contamination in other 
areas of the factory

• the allergens that may be handled in non-production areas of the site (e.g. in canteens or 
in new product development). A policy for food brought on site by staff, or used in vending 
machines or catering facilities, should be developed. The policy may ban certain allergens 
or restrict them to certain areas of the site.

Where colour-coding is used, consideration must be given to the choice of colours to 
ensure that colour-blind staff are able to identify the correct items.

5.3.5 Where rework is used, or reworking operations are carried out, procedures shall be 
implemented to ensure rework containing allergens is not used in products that do not 
already contain the allergen.

Interpretation Rework

Specific documented procedures must operate to prevent rework containing allergens from 
being used in products or processes that do not contain those allergens. Best practice is for 
rework to be used on a ‘like-for-like’ basis (i.e. it is used only in exactly the same product). 
The use of rework must be documented.

5.3.6 Where a justified, risk-based assessment demonstrates that the nature of the production 
process is such that cross-contamination (cross-contact) from an allergen cannot be 
prevented, a warning should be included on the label. Legislation, national guidelines or 
codes of practice shall be used when making such a warning statement.

Interpretation On-pack warning labels

Where well-implemented and managed allergen management controls cannot prevent 
cross-contamination (cross-contact) and there is a significant and genuine risk of the 
presence of an allergen that would not otherwise be present and is therefore not mentioned 
elsewhere on the product (e.g. in the ingredients list), the use of on-pack advisory warning 
labels should be considered – i.e. an on-pack, advisory, consumer-facing warning label 
stating that there is a risk of cross-contact from an allergen, which cannot be prevented. 
While different wording may be used in different countries (see below), such warnings are 
often referred to as ‘may contain’ labels, as they refer to unpreventable cross-contact rather 
than to the deliberate inclusion of the allergen in the product.

The use of a warning label should be justifiable on the basis of the risk assessment 
and procedure (clauses 5.3.3 and 5.3.4) and should not be a substitute for effective 
implementation of good manufacturing practices. Reference must be made to national 
legislation, guidelines or codes of practice when making such a statement to ensure that 
best practice is followed. For example, consideration should be given to:

• the location of the warning (preferably in close proximity to the ingredients list)
• the visibility of the statement – colour, highlighting, location and font size can all aid 

consumers
• the choice of the warning phrase used, so that the meaning is clear to consumers.

The site should consider:

• the allergens identified as important by the company, i.e. from the risk assessments and 
controls described above

• legislation in the country of intended sale (relating to both which allergens need to be 
labelled and the permitted warnings)

• customer requirements.

5.3.7 Where a claim is made regarding the suitability of a food for individuals with a food allergy 
or food sensitivity (sometimes referred to as a ‘food hyper-sensitivity’), the site shall ensure 
that the production process is fully validated to meet the stated claim and the effectiveness 
of the process is routinely verified. This shall be documented.

Interpretation Allergen claims

Allergic, food-intolerant and other food-hypersensitive individuals are likely to actively 
seek and choose products that claim to be suitable for them to consume (e.g. ‘gluten-free’ 
products). It is therefore essential that any allergen claim is based on rigorous controls to 
ensure its validity and continuous implementation to prevent adverse health consequences.

Where a claim is made regarding the suitability of a food, full validation and verification 
activities will be required to ensure that the claim is consistently met. Typically, this will 
include:

• reference to legislation or national guidelines on the permitted claims and the 
manufacturing requirements to make the claim. For example, some countries have been 
discussing tolerances or acceptable limits for allergen labelling

• demonstration that production processes are in place to ensure the product does not 
contain unacceptable traces of the allergen

continued

• analysis of the final product
• assessment of the adequacy of cleaning, as detailed in clause 5.3.8 (where the site also 

produces products containing the allergen about which the claim is made, additional 
verification controls will be required)

• raw material controls. In addition to the normal requirements listed in clause 5.3.1, 
additional validation/verification requirements are likely to be needed (e.g. raw material 
testing, additional supplier questionnaires, site audits).

The validation and verification activities must be recorded.

5.3.8 Equipment or area-cleaning procedures shall be designed to remove or reduce to acceptable 
levels any potential cross-contamination (cross-contact) by allergens. The cleaning methods 
shall be validated to ensure that they are effective and the effectiveness of the procedure 
routinely verified. Cleaning equipment used to clean allergenic materials shall either be:

• identifiable and specific for allergen use
• single use
• effectively cleaned after use.

Interpretation Allergen cleaning regimes

Some standard cleaning regimes will be insufficient to ensure the removal of all allergenic 
material. Therefore, specific cleaning procedures must be present on site where allergen-
containing materials require control.

Cleaning procedures must be designed to remove or reduce to acceptable levels any 
allergenic material. They must consider:

• cleaning schedules (i.e. when cleaning will be completed)
• scheduling sufficient time to fully complete the clean to the required standard
• ensuring that cleaning instructions contain all the information required
• the order in which cleaning must be performed (to ensure that cleaning does not move an 

allergen into a previously cleaned area)
• the cleaning equipment used for cleaning allergenic materials, which must not be a source 

of contamination and must therefore be either dedicated for the removal of that allergen, 
single use or effectively cleaned after use.

There is no internationally recognised definition of acceptable allergen levels; this would 
be dependent on the intended country of sale. For example, reference doses are being 
discussed in the EU (further information can be found on the German Federal Institute for 
Risk Assessment’s website).

Where multiple allergens are handled on site, consider whether all allergens could be 
managed by the same cleaning/validation/verification activities. For example, peanuts, 
milk and sesame seeds may need different controls because of their different physical 
characteristics. They may also be used on different equipment and production lines, again 
requiring separate consideration.

The effectiveness of the procedures must be validated. The validation must be documented 
and evidence will typically include:

• worst-case production/cleaning trials, where all equipment, processes and allergens need 
to be considered

• targeted test locations, such as food contact surfaces, difficult-to-clean areas, deadlegs etc.
• targeted samples, where worst-case samples are identified for laboratory testing using 

suitably sensitive test methods. (Validation tests should be accredited methods and, 
wherever possible, quantifiable. Rapid tests, ATP and lateral flow devices are good for 
verification activities but are not suitable for validation.) Possible samples include the 
first product manufactured in the next production run, rinse water from cleaning systems, 
swabs etc.

• assessment of new equipment for ease of cleaning prior to purchase
• positive testing of the test method used, to confirm that it will detect the allergen if it is 

present in a real sample (i.e. confirmation that product matrix will not interfere with the 
test).

It is likely that validation data will need to be collected from several 
production runs to ensure it is representative and complete. A number of best-
practice guidelines have been published on the validation of cleaning (e.g. 
Campden BRI Guideline 59 – Validation of Cleaning to Remove Food Allergens).

The cleaning procedures must be routinely verified by, for example:

• visual inspections and documented sign-off
• inclusion in internal audits
• the use of swabs or testing (e.g. rapid tests, ATP, lateral flow devices or laboratory tests).

Records must be maintained of validation and verification tests and activities. Any corrective 
actions must also be recorded and completed.

BRCGS has a training course on validation and verification. Further information is available 
on the BRCGS website.

5.4 Product authenticity, claims and chain of custody

Systems shall be in place to minimise the risk of purchasing fraudulent or adulterated food raw materials and to 
ensure that all product descriptions and claims are legal, accurate and verified.

Interpretation

The objectives of this section of the Standard are to ensure:

• the site has assessed its raw materials and supply chain for vulnerability to food fraud activities such as the 
dilution, substitution or misrepresentation of ingredients prior to delivery to the site, all of which could lead to the 
sale of unfit, illegal or potentially harmful products

• the site has appropriate controls in place (based on the assessment) to minimise the risk of purchasing fraudulent 
or adulterated raw materials

• all claims relating to raw materials used in products can be substantiated and that the audit provides a suitable 
evaluation of the site’s management of the chain of custody, where claims are made relating to primary agricultural 
schemes such as GLOBALG.A.P.

Note that the security of products, while under the management control of the company, is also an important aspect 
of fraud prevention. Security of products is covered in section 4.1 and food defence in section 4.2; this section 
focuses on the sourcing of raw materials and their vulnerability within the supply chain.

Section 1 of the Standard deals with senior management commitment in relation to product authenticity; for 
example, operating processes and objectives that facilitate product authenticity, and the importance of keeping 
up to date with emerging issues and relevant legislation. These activities complement this section; for example, 
knowledge of an emerging risk (clause 1.1.8) could be added to the information relating to potential fraud (clause 
5.4.2), instigating a review of the vulnerability assessment (clause 5.4.3).

This section applies to food raw materials and ingredients; therefore packaging does not need to be considered 
under this section.

Product claims are also covered in this section in clauses 5.4.5 (raw material status), 5.4.6 (certification and methods 
of production) and 5.4.7 (validation of claims, formulation, and methods of production).

Clause Requirements
5.4.1 Where personnel are engaged in vulnerability assessments, the individual or team 

responsible shall understand potential food fraud risks. This shall include knowledge of raw 
materials used by the site and the principles of vulnerability assessment.

Interpretation Competency of the vulnerability assessment and food fraud team

It is important that personnel completing vulnerability assessments for food fraud are 
competent to develop the plan; they need to understand the risk they are trying to prevent. 
Therefore, it is expected that within the team there will be knowledge of:

• the principles of food fraud (e.g. what food fraud is, why its management is important)
• risk assessment or vulnerability assessment techniques
• the risks associated with the raw material, product, supply chain or process being assessed.

The Standard is not prescriptive regarding how this knowledge is demonstrated and may, for 
example, include:

• formal training (e.g. a training course in food fraud, vulnerability assessment or VACCP)
• internal training, development and experience (e.g. demonstrable knowledge of the site)
• other competency (e.g. the completeness and effectiveness of the vulnerability 

assessment and its implementation).

Risk assessments may be completed either by responsible individuals or by a team. The 
advantage of a team is that every company has several departments that are likely to possess 
useful information; for example:

• technical or QA staff are often subject matter experts
• supplier approval will see information relating to specific raw materials, suppliers and 

supply chains
• purchasing departments are usually well informed about availability or pricing concerns
• goods receipt and production teams see the materials actually delivered to the site.

Where a team is used to complete assessments, it is important to consider the overall 
capability of the team.

If the site does not have the appropriate in-house knowledge, external expertise (e.g. food 
safety consultants) may be used; however, reference should be made to clause 1.2.4 and 
section 3.5.3.

5.4.2 The company shall have processes in place to access information on historical and 

developing threats to the supply chain which may present a risk of adulteration or 
substitution of raw materials (i.e. fraudulent raw materials). Such information may come from, 
for example:

• trade associations
• government sources
• private resource centres
• activities completed for clause 1.1.8.

Interpretation Provision of knowledge and information

Information relating to the adulteration or substitution of raw materials constantly changes 
as new risks are identified and existing ones are managed. The objective of this clause is 
therefore to ensure that sites remain up to date with emerging issues and are able to adapt 
their systems to protect their products against new and existing risks to the authenticity of 
their products.

The company must be able to demonstrate that it maintains up-to-date knowledge of 
relevant scientific and technical developments, emerging issues and known risks relating 
to the authenticity of the raw materials it purchases and the potential for food fraud in the 
supply chain. The company’s systems therefore must ensure that information is reliably 
obtained and reviewed in a timely manner. Ideally the company should be proactive, looking 
for and reviewing information, rather than reacting to situations that have already occurred. 
Mechanisms to achieve this may include:

• membership of a trade association which provides this service
• help from government officials or local enforcement offices
• subscription to a service provider supplying updates on food fraud
• regular review of reputable, quality information sources such as websites covering food 

fraud.

The auditor will look for evidence of systematic checking and a process for ensuring the 
information is transferred into action as necessary (clause 5.4.3).

Information may be obtained and collated as part of the provision of technical knowledge 
(clause 1.1.8) or as a separate exercise, providing it is clear that relevant information is 
being obtained. Good practice is to reference data sources, as this allows later reference; 
for example, if further details are required or an update occurs. There are many different 
types of information that may indicate fraud and are useful when completing or updating a 
vulnerability assessment; examples are listed in clause 5.4.3 and its interpretation.

A number of organisations provide information and updates on food fraud risks; for 
example:

• European Commission Knowledge Centre for Food Fraud and Quality
• Reports from Operation OPSON.

Clause Requirements
5.4.3 A documented vulnerability assessment shall be carried out on all food raw materials or 

groups of raw materials to assess the potential risk of adulteration or substitution. This shall 
take into account:

• historical evidence of substitution or adulteration
• economic factors which may make adulteration or substitution more attractive
• ease of access to raw materials through the supply chain
• sophistication of routine testing to identify adulterants
• the nature of the raw material.

The output from this assessment shall be a documented vulnerability assessment plan.

This plan shall be kept under review to reflect changing economic circumstances and market 
intelligence which may alter the potential risks. It shall be reviewed annually and whenever 
there is:

• a change in raw materials or a supplier of raw materials
• emergence of a new risk (e.g. known adulteration of an ingredient or developments in 

scientific information associated with authenticity of the site’s products or raw materials, 
for example, information obtained as part of clause 1.1.8)

• following a significant product safety incident (e.g. a product recall) where the authenticity 
of the site’s products or raw materials is implicated.

Interpretation Vulnerability assessment

A vulnerability assessment is a search for potential weaknesses in the supply chain in order 
to prevent food fraud (i.e. to prevent the adulteration or substitution of raw materials before 
they arrive at the site). It is a specialised form of risk assessment, and needs a systematic and 
structured approach to ensure data gathering, identification of significant food fraud hazards, 
assessment of likelihood of occurrence, and identification and implementation of controls 
to mitigate genuine risks. The aim of the assessment is not to assess the potential for fraud 
at the site, but to examine the supply chain for potential concerns or weaknesses, thereby 
identifying those raw materials that are at particular risk of adulteration or substitution, so 
that appropriate controls can be put in place (clause 5.4.4).

The vulnerability assessment will consider information relating to each ingredient in order 
to assess whether there is a potential for food fraud. Where a site purchases a number of 
similar raw materials, it may be possible to consider these as a group rather than each raw 
material individually, providing the risks are similar. The company will need to ensure that all 
food materials are subject to a vulnerability assessment.

Typical information to incorporate into the assessment includes:

• any emerging issues and information identified in clause 5.4.2
• historical evidence of substitution or adulteration of the ingredient
• cost/value of the material
• availability (e.g. a poor harvest may restrict availability and may increase the potential for 

adulteration)
• sophistication of routine testing to identify adulterants. If testing within the supply chain 

is comprehensive and specifically focused on potential fraud issues, then the likelihood 
of adulteration is reduced (e.g. fruit juice is often tested for a comprehensive range of 
parameters, including DNA, isotopic analysis, added sugars and added water to prevent 
potential fraud)

• country of origin
• length and complexity of the supply chain
• supply chain model
• controls that are already in the supply chain. For example, if the raw material supplier 

is certificated to the Standard, then as part of that certification the supplier must have 
completed its own vulnerability assessment, and there is no requirement in the Standard 
for the site to duplicate its supplier’s vulnerability assessment.

The nature of the raw material may change the potential for food fraud. For example, if a 
slaughterhouse is purchasing cattle, horses and pigs for slaughter, it will be obvious if there 
is an issue with the live animals; however, if the slaughterhouse intends to make a claim 
such as organic, Aberdeen Angus or specified country of origin, then greater controls of 
raw materials will be required to ensure only those which meet the claim are purchased. 
Similarly, prepared ingredients such as beef mince or ground spices are likely to have a 
greater risk than the whole ingredient.

The Standard does not define the exact process that the site must follow when completing 
the vulnerability assessment; however, it is likely to incorporate the following steps:

• draw up a list of raw materials (or groups of raw materials) and the controls (e.g. product 
testing, traceability systems or supply chain audits) that are already in operation

• consider the information obtained from clause 5.4.2 for each ingredient
• complete a risk assessment on the vulnerability of each ingredient.

Note that the Standard does not require full supply chain mapping for all raw materials, 
although this may be a useful tool where a risk assessment indicates that a genuine risk 
exists and there is a need to identify the point in the supply chain where an effective control 
can be applied.

The output of the vulnerability assessment must include a documented vulnerability 
assessment plan which should rank or score the materials to identify those which need 
additional controls. The ranking and actions required could, for example, be as follows:

• Very high  A high-profile raw material with recent reports of adulteration published by 
regulatory authorities. Action or monitoring is required to ensure only genuine materials 
are purchased

• High  A high-profile material that provides an attractive target for potential adulteration. 
Some action and/or monitoring is required to ensure only genuine materials are purchased

• Low  This material is unlikely to be a target for substitution or adulteration; however a re-
assessment may be necessary if new information becomes available

• Negligible  No further action required as the material is extremely unlikely to be a target 
for food fraud.

As mentioned earlier in this interpretation, situations relating to food fraud change, and it 
is therefore important that the company has a dynamic system that can react to and assess 
new information as it becomes available, thereby ensuring the vulnerability assessment 
remains up to date. At a minimum, the vulnerability assessment must be reviewed at least 
annually and when there is a significant change to the ingredient. As a guide, a review may be 
triggered by the following, although this is not an exhaustive list:

• a change in the financial situation of raw material suppliers or countries of origin
• a change in cost of raw materials, either upwards or downwards

• a change in material availability (e.g. because of seasonal shortages)
• emergence of a new risk (e.g. known adulteration of an ingredient)
• developments in scientific information associated with ingredients, process or product
• information received as part of a supplier approval or raw material risk assessment (e.g. 

clause 3.5.1.1) which highlights new or evolving risks.

A number of risk assessment tools have been published. These include some specialist 
vulnerability assessment tools such as CARVER + Shock and TACCP (threat assessment 
and critical control points), which may be used to achieve a structured approach to the 
assessment process.

BRCGS has published a number of items to assist with vulnerability assessments. These 
include a specific vulnerability assessment guideline that can be obtained from the 
BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate, and a training course available through 
BRCGS Performance Enhancement and its global network of approved training providers.

A number of organisations have produced tools to assist with food fraud and vulnerability 
assessments, including, for example, the Food Fraud Resilience Self-Assessment Tool 
available on the UK FSA website.

5.4.4 Where raw materials are identified as being at particular risk of adulteration or substitution, 
the vulnerability assessment plan shall include appropriate assurance and/or testing 
processes to mitigate the identified risks.

Interpretation Output from the vulnerability assessment

Where raw materials are identified as being of particular risk of adulteration or substitution, 
appropriate assurance controls need to be in place to ensure that only genuine materials are 
purchased. Depending on the perceived risk, assurance controls may include:

• certificates of analysis from raw material suppliers
• raw material testing
• supply chain audits
• use of tamper evidence or seals on incoming raw materials
• enhanced supplier approval checks
• mass balance exercises at the raw material supplier
• changes to the supply chain (e.g. a change of supplier or a move to a shorter supply chain).

It is worth noting that the best controls are proactive and continuous as these are the most 
likely to prevent an incident from occurring. For example, product testing is a useful tool but 
it is reactive (i.e. it can only tell you if something has happened; it cannot prevent it from 
occurring or recurring in future).

• assurance claims (e.g. GLOBALG.A.P. , Red Tractor, Marine Stewardship, dolphin-friendly 

tuna and sustainable palm oil)
• identity-preserved claims (e.g. GMO-free).

Claims which relate to the composition of the product (e.g. nutritional claims, fat-free, 
reduced sugar, free-from) are covered in clauses 5.3.7 and 5.4.7.

It is the responsibility of the site to make reasonable checks to ensure that the raw materials 
supplied are genuine and that claims made about ingredients are proven.

For many assurance schemes, such as GLOBALG.A.P. , it is possible to check the assurance 
status and the scope of products of the supplier on a database. Reliance solely on a 
declaration from a supplier will not be sufficient. Where claims relate to variety or species 
(e.g. varieties of fruit), examination of visual characteristics may suffice. However, for claims 
where visual analysis is not possible (e.g. block frozen fish), certificates of analysis and 
periodic sample analysis will be required.

Full traceability records must be maintained, as required in section 3.9. The records must 
also include details of the quantities purchased and amounts used at each step to enable a 
mass balance exercise to be undertaken.

In the absence of more frequent requirements relating to a particular scheme, the site must 
undertake a mass balance traceability exercise on typical products for which a claim is made 
at least every 6 months. This must ensure that the system of records maintained enables 
all finished product batches to be identified for a particular batch of raw materials and that, 
for a given finished product, the batch(es) of raw materials used for its production can be 
identified. The test must be carried out in both directions.

Interpretation 
continued

The ingredients selected for the mass balance exercise must include the ingredient for 
which a claim is made. The objective is to test the systems and, where necessary, make 
improvements to information recording to allow claims to be substantiated should they be 
challenged by a customer or legal authority.

It follows that, where very different traceability systems are used within, for example, a 
complex or multi-product site, more than one mass balance traceability exercise may be 
required every 6 months to ensure that all systems are working effectively. However, where 
a site has multiple claims, it is not intended that every claim be mass balance tested every 
6 months but that a representative selection of claims are chosen. In this situation, good 
practice would be to choose different claims or products each time the test is conducted.

The use of a third-party mass balance exercise (e.g. by an organic certifier or by the Fairtrade 
Foundation) would be acceptable evidence of a test, providing that records of the test, 
the results and evidence of any necessary improvements made as a result of the test are 
maintained.

Where the third-party scheme measures the mass balance over a period (e.g. 1 month) 
rather than for a single batch code this is considered acceptable providing the requirements 
discussed above are met. If, as part of the requirements for a particular scheme or to use a 
logo, there is a requirement for more frequent mass balance traceability exercises, then that 
scheme’s requirements must be met.

5.4.6 Where claims are made about the methods of production (e.g. organic, halal, kosher), the site 
shall maintain the necessary certification status in order to make such a claim.

Interpretation Certificated third-party standards

Where a site wishes to make claims relating to specific production methods, such as organic, 
Halal or Kosher, the site is responsible for maintaining the appropriate certification to those 
standards.

While the accuracy of the production methods relating to these third-party certification 
standards will not be assessed during a BRCGS audit, the auditor will require evidence that 
the appropriate certification is in place (e.g. by reviewing the certificate or an online database 
of certificated sites).

5.4.7 Where a product is designed to enable a claim to be made, the company shall ensure that 
all claims are substantiated, and product formulation and the production process are fully 
validated to meet the stated claim and any legal requirements (in the country of intended 
sale) relating to the claim.

The process flow (see clause 2.5.1) for the production of products where claims are made 
shall be documented and potential areas for contamination or loss of identity identified.

Appropriate controls shall be established to ensure the integrity of the product claims.

Interpretation Claims and loss of identity

Where a particular claim about the formulation of a product has been made, procedures 
must be in place to:

• validate that the claim is correct (this should include all steps in the process including, for 
example, label design, raw material sourcing and production)

• ensure legal requirements relating to the claim in the country of intended sale are met; for 
example, in the EU, nutritional claims are defined

• identify and prevent potential sources of contamination, loss of identity or variation which 
adversely affects the claim; for example, by using the process flow diagram to identify 
steps in the manufacturing process where product may be located in shared production 
areas or on shared lines.

For example, an on-pack claim that a product is plant-based or vegetarian would need to be 
validated, and this may include:

• inclusion of the claim in raw material risk assessment, supplier approval and specifications
• inclusion of the claim in the food safety plan, e.g. use of the process flow (see below) 

leading to specific controls such as segregation and dedicated equipment, or validated 
cleaning regimes

• review of the production processes, equipment segregation etc.

Good practice is to ensure that a programme of ongoing verification and monitoring is in 
place to demonstrate that claims are consistently met.

Claims such as ‘free from allergen’ and ‘allergen-free’ need particular care to ensure that 
cross-contamination cannot occur during processing. This is covered separately in clause 
5.3.7.

The process flow diagram used within the food safety plan (or HACCP process) may be used 
as the basis for demonstrating compliance with this clause (the requirement may already 
be covered within the HACCP or food safety plan). The site must identify (e.g. as a list or on 
the process flow) potential areas where mixing of products or loss of identity may occur. 
Procedures of working or changes in process flow must be introduced to reduce the risk of 
mistakes and false claims being made. For example, in a large packhouse packing both farm-
assured and non-farm-assured fruit, the farm-assured fruit is always stored separately within 
dedicated cold stores. Grading and packing operations are organised so that the packing of 
farm-assured product occurs first or on particular packing lines.

5.5 Product packaging

Product packaging and processes for the purchase of product packaging shall be appropriate for the intended use. 
Packaging shall be stored under conditions to prevent contamination and minimise deterioration.

Interpretation

Consideration of packaging and the process for the purchase of product packaging is crucial for ensuring the 
ongoing integrity of the product (i.e. ensuring it is clean, is of the appropriate quality and minimises product 
deterioration), and in maintaining product safety and legality (e.g. preventing product contamination).

Clause Requirements
5.5.1 When purchasing or specifying primary packaging, the supplier of packaging materials shall 

be made aware of any particular characteristics of the food or existing packaging (e.g. high 
fat content, pH, usage conditions such as microwaving, other packaging used on the product, 
use of recyclable or reusable packaging materials) which may affect packaging suitability.

Certificates of conformity or other evidence shall be available for primary packaging to 
confirm it complies with applicable food safety legislation and is suitable for its intended 
use.

Interpretation Compliance with legislative requirements

There have been incidences of product recalls which have resulted from a lack of 
communication between the supplier of the packaging materials and the food manufacturer, 
typically where a packaging material has been used in extreme product conditions or where 
packaging not designed for direct food contact has been used (e.g. a plastic liner of a carton 
is removed or changed to reduce costs).

The company must be able to demonstrate that each item of product packaging meets legal 
requirements for its use (e.g. compliance with food contact regulations in the country of 
sale). This may be in the form of specifications, migration data or a certificate of conformity. 
Where a declaration of conformity is used, any limitations on usage must be stated (e.g. the 
food types or storage conditions: ambient, chilled or frozen).

The supplier of the packaging must be made aware of the conditions under which the 
packaging is going to be used, so that the suitability of the packaging materials can be 
confirmed. This may take the form of a specification provided to the packaging supplier and 
would include, as appropriate:

• contact with food – direct food contact or, where not used for direct food contact, the 
nature of the barrier layer

• characteristics of the food – any adverse characteristics of the food which may increase 
migration of chemicals from the packaging (e.g. high fat content, or low or high product 
pH)

• conditions of processing (e.g. high-temperature fill, thermal processing in pack, or freezing)
• expected customer usage (e.g. microwave in pack, cooking in pack, or freezing)
• use of recyclable or reusable packaging materials
• other packaging, especially where the components will be supplied by different companies 

and there is a need for compatibility between the component parts (e.g. a bottle and cap 
manufactured and supplied by different suppliers).

Direct food contact materials are of most concern as these have the greatest potential 
for harm and many geographical regions have specific legislation around direct contact 
packaging. However, there may be risk associated with the additional layers of packaging, 
particularly labelling which often comprises the primary pack (consumer unit) and also 
secondary packaging such as corrugated cases. Physical or chemical contamination can 
occur from these packaging components.

Discussions with the provider of packaging materials are imperative to ensure that the right 
materials in the right configurations are used (e.g. it may be necessary to use lower levels 
of recycled content in a corrugated case for products that are susceptible to chemical 
migration). Extensive work at the start of the process is incredibly valuable and can prevent 
costly errors from being made in specifications.

It is also vital to consider the product supply chain to establish the most appropriate 
packaging, given the storage and distribution conditions that the product will be subjected 
to.

The requirement allows some flexibility in the approach used; for example, a site could use 
risk assessment to identify the appropriate controls, and establish the level of evidence that 
is satisfactory for the level of risk (although the site would need to ensure that any legal 
requirements were addressed). For example, in the EU the site may decide that it needs 
to review an EU Declaration of Compliance (DoC) for Food Contact Materials due to a 
perceived risk of migration.

The site would need to demonstrate that the evidence available is appropriate for the 
level of risk associated with the packaging – it would not be acceptable to list the clause 
as ‘not applicable’, as there should also be evidence that the matter has been adequately 
communicated/discussed with the packaging supplier.

BRCGS has published a guideline on migration from packaging materials into food, which 
may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate.

5.5.2 Product liners and bags purchased by the company for use in direct contact with ingredients, 
or work in process, shall be appropriately coloured (e.g. contrasting colour to the product) 
and resistant to tearing to prevent accidental contamination.

Interpretation Product contact liners

Materials used as liners for containers, as covers for work in progress or as bags for prepared 
ingredients may themselves be a source of contamination. Such packaging materials must be 
visually distinct from the product (e.g. blue or red) and of a sufficient thickness to reduce the 
potential for ripping or being damaged. Good practice is to ensure that bag and film gauges 
are documented and communicated to suppliers to ensure that only suitable materials are 
purchased.

The requirement applies only to materials purchased by the site and used on site; it does 
not apply to finished product packing. However, suppliers of raw materials should be 
strongly encouraged to supply ingredients in accordance with this requirement to reduce 
the risk of packaging contaminating products.

Where companies are producing products for further processing, clear liners should not be 
used as they present a potential hazard for the next manufacturer.

This clause does not apply to packaging used for sale to the final consumer.

5.5.3 The company shall have a procedure to manage obsolete packaging (including labels). This 
shall include:

• mechanisms to prevent accidental use of obsolete packaging
• control and disposal of obsolete packaging
• appropriate procedures for the disposal of obsolete printed materials (e.g. rendering 

trademarked materials unusable).

Interpretation Obsolete packaging

Mis-labelling and mis-packing of product is a common cause of product recall. This is of 
particular concern when, for example, allergens are introduced which are not accurately 
reflected on the labelling. Effective management of packaging materials, particularly those 
that are printed, can minimise the risk of these incidents.

One of the key aspects of this management is the effective control of obsolete packaging 
(i.e. items that are no longer required) such as those that are out of date because of a change 
in the ingredients used in the product. At a minimum sites should have:

• mechanisms to prevent the accidental use of obsolete packaging (e.g. physical segregation 
in storage areas, clear ‘do not use’ labelling, blocks in electronic inventory systems)

• controls for the disposal of obsolete packaging (e.g. timescales for the disposal of 
materials; how accidental use will be prevented while waiting for disposal; and how 
materials will be disposed of)

• appropriate procedures for the disposal of obsolete printed materials (e.g. rendering 
trademarked materials such as out-of-date labels unusable).

5.6 Product inspection, on-site product testing and laboratory analysis

The company shall undertake or subcontract inspection and analyses which are critical to confirm product safety, 
authenticity, legality and quality, using appropriate procedures, facilities and standards.

Interpretation

The company needs to identify and schedule the inspection and analyses which are critical for the products it 
produces. For example, critical analyses may include:

• known product safety risks associated with the product type or identified during the HACCP risk assessment
• legal requirements, particularly those associated with the country of intended sale (where this is known)
• product authenticity (e.g. where a genuine risk of adulteration, substitution or fraud has been identified during the 

vulnerability assessment described in section 5.4)
• quality attributes (e.g. where these form part of a specification agreed with the customer).

The frequency and type of inspection and tests are not prescribed by the Standard as these should be risk-based 
and specific to the type of products (see clause 5.6.1).

Clause Requirements
5.6.1 There shall be a scheduled programme of product testing which may include 

microbiological, chemical, physical and organoleptic testing according to risk. The methods, 
processes for obtaining product samples (including, where appropriate, their delivery to a 
laboratory), frequency and specified limits shall be documented.

Interpretation Product test schedules

The company needs to have a documented schedule of tests which are carried out on 
the products. The objective of these tests is to ensure that products are manufactured to 
specification and in compliance with safety and legislative requirements. The HACCP or 
food safety plan is likely to identify some of the tests required and their frequency. However, 
other tests which ensure the quality of the product and which may not have been included 
in assessments of product safety must be considered. For example, tests may be identified 
to:

• monitor for a potential contaminant (e.g. pesticides, heavy metals or microbiological 
contamination)

• test for conformity to a specification or claim (e.g. nutritional content)
• monitor trends (e.g. environmental monitoring of the site environment – see section 4.11.8 

for full details)
• confirm compliance with a customer’s quality requirements
• monitor potential food fraud or food defence concerns (e.g. as an output from food 

defence or food fraud assessments – see sections 4.2 and 5.4).

The processes for obtaining product samples, including, where necessary, their delivery 
to a laboratory, must be considered and will be dependent on the production process, the 
type of product, and whether the test is completed on site or at an external laboratory. For 
example:

• how the sample is removed from the production flow – identifying the correct product, 
preventing contamination of the rest of the production, confirming the correct quantity is 
taken

• sample integrity – to ensure that the sample is fit for analysis; for example, protecting 
it from contamination or adverse treatment (e.g. maintaining appropriate product 
temperature and respecting any time limitations for chilled or frozen products prior to 
microbiological testing)

• clear labelling of samples with relevant information, including traceability
• where required, procedures for:

• storage of samples before testing
• delivery to a laboratory
• clear communication with the laboratory.

The frequency and type of product tests should be based on risk and on any particular 
customer requirements. The site is expected to be able to explain and justify the basis for 
the frequency of tests with reference to historical or scientific information as appropriate.

The test method and specifications for each test must be documented. Where the results 
of a test include subjective criteria (e.g. bake colour, texture or organoleptic tests), colour 
standards or reference samples must be used to provide a reference point for the test results 
(i.e. to define pass/fail criteria).

Where tests are completed on site, the location of the testing should be considered; for 
example, laboratory facilities will need appropriate siting and controls (clause 5.6.5) and 
organoleptic tests should be completed in a designated area and not on the production line.

Where legal limits apply, these shall be understood and appropriate action taken promptly 
to address any exceedance of these limits.

Where applicable, the measurement uncertainty associated with laboratory test results shall 
be considered.

Interpretation Reviewing test results

Systems of recording and review must be formalised and must include evidence of actions 
taken on identified trends, or where unsatisfactory results have been recorded. The use of 
graphs or charts of test results provides a good method of identifying trends and anomalous 
results.

Wherever testing is carried out, criteria (e.g. acceptable limits, action limits or legal limits) 
shall be established and documented, so results can be interpreted.

It is important that the receiving site understands the test results and the content of any test 
report and can interpret their significance.

Where test results are found to be outside established limits, there must be clear protocols 
on the actions to be taken (e.g. product hold, additional testing, customer notification, 
product withdrawal or recall). Appropriate actions should be implemented promptly to 
address unsatisfactory results or trends and thus protect consumer safety, product quality, 
legality and brand reputation.

Records of the results, review and any actions taken should be maintained.

The site must agree with the laboratory on how the measurement uncertainty shall be 
applied to results (for some tests, in some countries, this may be defined by legislation).

Measurement 
uncertainty

Measurement uncertainty (sometimes simply referred to as ‘uncertainty’) is a parameter 
associated with the result of a quantitative measurement. It is defined as the range of the 
values that could reasonably be expected for the attribute (e.g. the micro-organism, allergen 
or chemical) being measured. It is sometimes known as the ‘margin of doubt’ of the result.

Measurement uncertainty is important when making conformity decisions (i.e. assessing 
whether a test result is within legal, safety or acceptable limits), as the range of probable 
values may cross one of these limits.

No matter what method is used, it will be subject to challenges inherent in taking the 
measurements accurately, day-to-day variations (e.g. in equipment, reagents, personnel 
or environmental conditions), and any systematic errors, random errors or corrections 
associated with the test; therefore the result obtained is the best estimate of the value.

Random errors are errors that fluctuate due to the unpredictability or uncertainty inherent 
in the measuring process, or the variation in the quantity being measured (i.e. variation 
throughout the sample or product being tested, and this is often demonstrated by the 
normal variation seen in replicate measurements of the same material). A systematic 
error is one that originates from a persistent issue and leads to a consistent error in the 
measurements; for example, recovery.

Measurement 
uncertainty 
continued

Product testing is often completed to establish compliance with limits; i.e. to demonstrate 
that a product meets the requirements defined in its specification, by regulations and 
by customers. Knowing the measurement uncertainty is important when making these 
conformity decisions. For illustrative purposes only, in Figure 20, the horizontal line 
represents the target value or limit; values above this fall outside the permitted range, and 
values below it are within the permitted range.

A

B

C

D

Figure 20  Example of the possible effects of measurement uncertainty

Results A and D are well above or well below the limit, and thus applying the measurement 
uncertainty value will not change the conformity statement made (e.g. A is still outside the 
limit and D is still in specification). It is in results B and C where measurement uncertainty 
would impact on the conformity.

The value obtained for C is within the limit. However, if the result and measurement 
uncertainty are combined, the value represented by C may fall above the limit and thus be 
out of specification.

The value obtained for B is above the limit and therefore would be out of specification, but 
taking measurement uncertainty into consideration, there is a potential that B could fall 
below the threshold (i.e. be within specification).

Applying measurement uncertainty in this manner needs careful consideration and 
justification depending on the risk, applicable legislation or customer requirements. Where 
the test is of a critical parameter (e.g. product safety or legality), measurement uncertainty 
must not be used to prevent taking the correct action to protect consumers and/or maintain 
legality.

5.6.3 The site shall ensure that a system of validation and ongoing verification of the shelf life 
is in place. This shall be based on risk and shall include sensory analysis and, as applicable, 
microbiological testing and relevant chemical factors such as pH and aw. Records and results 
from shelf-life tests shall verify the shelf-life period indicated on the product.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Shelf-life verification

Shelf-life testing may be critical to product safety; for example, where the product is 
susceptible to the growth of pathogens. Therefore, after the initial shelf life is determined 
(see clause 5.1.4), the site is expected to have a programme of ongoing shelf-life validation 
and verification across its range of products or product types. To achieve this, samples 
should be retained from some or all production runs.

Records must be available supporting the declared shelf life for each product or group of 
similar products. These may include microbiological and sensory analyses, as well as relevant 
chemical factors such as pH and aw. Shelf-life trials extending beyond the stated life of the 
product, to ensure a margin of safety, may be required for some product types.

5.6.4 Pathogen testing (including pathogens tested as part of the site’s environmental monitoring 
programme) shall be subcontracted to an external laboratory or, where conducted internally, 
the laboratory facility shall be fully segregated from the production and storage areas and 
have operating procedures to prevent any risk of contamination of products or production 
areas.

Interpretation Pathogen-testing facilities

The requirements apply specifically to the testing of pathogens, and not to general 
microbiological tests such as those for yeasts and moulds, total viable count (TVC), coliforms 
or Enterobacteriaceae (while these need to be carefully controlled, they present a lower 
level of risk).

If pathogen-testing facilities are not carefully managed, they could present a risk to 
products. Pathogen testing also tends to be a specialised activity requiring specific facilities, 
and consequently it is usually outsourced to a specialist laboratory.

Where pathogen testing is carried out on the production site, the laboratory facility must 
be physically segregated (ideally in a separate building) from production, food-handling 
and storage areas. The company must have documented procedures to prevent product 
contamination and must be able to justify the controls in place. Consideration of the design 
of the laboratory is covered in clause 5.6.5.

Facilities for testing pathogens, their location (in relation to production and food-storage/
handling operations) and containment arrangements may be subject to legislation and/or 
guidelines, which the site will need to comply with.

Allergens and other contaminant tests, for example, will also require suitable facilities, with 
procedures for the delivery and removal of samples from the laboratory (i.e. this should not 
be done via production or food-handling areas).

For environmental monitoring testing methods and use of rapid testing kits and ATP 
swabbing, see section 4.11.8.

5.6.5 Where testing laboratories are present on a manufacturing site, they shall be located,

• operating procedures to contain laboratory activities, including the design and operation 
of drainage and ventilation systems

• access and security of the facility
• movement of laboratory personnel
• hygiene and protective clothing arrangements
• movement of materials that may pose a risk to products, raw materials or the production 

area, into and out of the laboratory, including the disposal of laboratory waste
• the management and monitoring of laboratory equipment.

Where testing activities are performed in production or storage areas (e.g. at the line tests or 
rapid tests), these shall be located, designed and operated to prevent product contamination.

Interpretation Design of laboratory facilities

If a laboratory is present within the site, documented control procedures are required to 
eliminate potential risks to product safety. These include:

• appropriate containment of the work, i.e. design and operating procedures that ensure that 
product and production areas cannot be contaminated by laboratory samples or laboratory 
activities

• drainage and ventilation systems; for example, by ensuring the drainage does not flow 
through the production areas

• restricted or controlled access for authorised personnel only
• procedures which ensure that protective clothing arrangements are suitable (e.g. not 

wearing laboratory clothing in other areas of the site, especially in production and storage 
areas) and coat change procedures

• movement of materials to and from the laboratory (e.g. laboratory consumables, chemicals, 
reference materials, equipment and laboratory waste)

• hygiene procedures such as hand-washing on entry to the area.

Where at-line testing is undertaken, measures shall be in place to protect the integrity of 
testing and production activities (e.g. by locating them in designated areas away from the 
production line, and allowing them to be completed only by trained and authorised staff).

Accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025, or a similar recognised national standard with equivalent 
requirements, will demonstrate that the laboratory meets these requirements.

5.6.6 Where the company undertakes or subcontracts analyses which are critical to product 
safety, authenticity or legality, the laboratory or subcontractors shall have gained recognised 
laboratory accreditation or operate in accordance with the requirements and principles of 
ISO/IEC 17025, including proficiency testing where applicable. Documented justification

Interpretation Analyses critical to safety and legality

This clause applies to tests which are critical to product safety or legality. Results from such 
tests must be credible and may be called upon in a court of law.

The company needs to identify which tests are critical to product safety, authenticity or 
legality, such as compliance with label claims or declarations (e.g. nutritional claims, alcohol 
content) and tests for contamination (e.g. pesticides, aflatoxins), and verify that they are fit 
for purpose; for example, by confirming that the laboratory and method is covered by the 
laboratory’s accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 for the product/material in question.

Note that while the laboratory itself may have accreditation, the actual test methods must 
also be accredited, as laboratory accreditation will relate to specific testing activities, and 
may not cover all of the services that the laboratory provides. The specific tests should 
be defined within the laboratory’s schedule of accreditation. Any method of analysis 
that is not accredited needs justification as to why it was used (e.g. it may be a method 
for which no accreditation is yet available). Where critical tests are carried out by non-
accredited laboratories or with non-accredited methods (either contracted or on-site 
laboratories), there must be suitable documented evidence that the laboratory is working 
to the requirements and principles of ISO/IEC 17025. This must include confirmation of the 
laboratory’s procedures to meet the following general principles:

• document control
• defined responsibilities and authority
• staff competency and documented training
• documented test methodology based on accepted standards
• equipment that is fit for purpose and appropriately calibrated
• a documented quality assurance programme, including proficiency testing (this is 

interlaboratory analysis, where multiple laboratories test the same material to allow 
a comparison of the results. A site or laboratory can therefore demonstrate that the 
test procedures used are working effectively and equivalent to those used in other 
laboratories)

• completion of internal audits of the laboratory’s operation.

Other good practices include:

• equipment control (e.g. maintenance, calibration, traceability to recognised standards, 
monitoring and result appraisal)

• validation of methods and materials to confirm fitness for purpose (e.g. test methods, 
equipment, test kits, reagents, chemicals)

• quality-monitoring processes (e.g. proficiency tests, reference materials)
• appropriate monitoring of environmental conditions
• communication systems between the site and laboratory
• completeness of record-keeping
• management of non-conforming laboratory work
• review of laboratory performance and operations.

Clause Requirements
5.6.7 Procedures shall be in place to ensure reliability of laboratory results, other than those 

critical to safety and legality specified in clause 5.6.6. These shall include:

• use of recognised test methods, where available
• documented testing procedures
• ensuring staff are suitably qualified and/or trained and competent to carry out the analysis 

required
• use of a system to verify the accuracy of test results (e.g. proficiency testing where 

applicable)
• use of appropriately calibrated and maintained equipment.

Interpretation Management of tests not critical to safety and legality

This requirement applies to non-critical product testing. While such tests need not be 
carried out by a laboratory accredited to ISO/IEC 17025, it is nonetheless important that the 
results can be relied upon. The clause sets out the documented procedures which must be 
in place to provide confidence in reliability.

In accordance with good laboratory practice, all laboratory testing should be suitability-
controlled irrespective of the nature of the tests. Clause 5.6.6 clarifies the requirements for 
tests relating to product safety, authenticity and legality.

5.7 Product release

The site shall ensure that finished product is not released unless all agreed procedures have been followed.

Interpretation

The site must have a process to ensure that finished product is not released from its control until all production 
checks have been completed and reviewed. Completion of end-product testing may not be applicable prior to 
the release of all products. (An example would be microbiological checks on short-shelf-life products such as 
sandwiches.) However, there must be appropriate checks on the CCPs to ensure that the process was within 
specification before product is released from the company’s control. This allows product to be held when a review 
of the process checks identifies a potential problem.

Clause Requirements
5.7.1 Where products require positive release, procedures shall be in place to ensure that release 

does not occur until all release criteria have been completed and the release has been 
authorised.

Interpretation Management of positive release

Where products are held either on or off site awaiting positive release, there need to be 
documented procedures describing the process for release and who authorises it. The 
procedures need to be sufficiently robust so that accidental release cannot occur; for 
example, having password control on a computerised system to prevent unauthorised 
picking of held product, or using the physical identification of pallets in the warehouse.

5.8 Pet food and animal feed

Where a site produces pet food or animal feed, all the relevant requirements from sections 1–7 of the Standard must 
be fulfilled in addition to the requirements in this section.

Interpretation

For example, pet food and animal feed need to be considered as part of the food safety plan (HACCP), as detailed 
within section 2 of the Standard.

Where a site produces by-products of the food manufacturing process or sells downgraded/surplus products for 
animal feed, the requirements for this process are detailed in section 4.13, especially clause 4.13.3.

Where a site does not manufacture pet food/animal feed, this section can be marked as not applicable (n/a).

The site shall ensure that pet food and animal feed products are safe and fit for intended use.

Interpretation

Pet food and/or animal feed is manufactured in the same type of environment as food for human consumption, but 
there are some specific additional requirements that reflect the nature of pet food and animal feed manufacture.

Clause Requirements
5.8.1 The site shall ensure that pet food and animal feed is formulated/designed for the intended 

use (e.g. where products are designed for complete diet or as a complementary product).

Interpretation Pet food and animal feed product development

Pet food and animal feed are unique in that a product can be designed for complete diet (i.e. 
a pet may eat the same product at every meal, often without other additions to the diet) or 
as a complementary product (e.g. as an addition to certain meals or as an occasional treat). 
The formulation and design (e.g. nutritional composition, portion size etc.) is therefore 
likely to be different depending on the intended frequency of consumption (complete or 
complementary).

Auditors will expect to see documented evidence that this formulation requirement 
has been considered (e.g. in new product development processes, recipe design and/or 
specifications).

5.8.2 Where a site’s product range includes pet food or animal feed products for different animal 
species, the site shall have specific procedures for the management of any ingredients, raw 
materials, products or rework that could be harmful to unintended recipients.

Interpretation Pet foods and animal feeds for different species

Sites that produce pet food and/or animal feed for many different animal species (e.g. cats, 
dogs, fish) must be aware that some ingredients cannot be safely eaten by all species without 
deleterious effect. For example, there are foods that can be fed to cats but not dogs because 
of their different dietary requirements. Therefore, sites should consider:

• a system to identify materials that could potentially be harmful to unintended recipients 
(i.e. to other species of pets). This shall include raw materials, processing aids, intermediate 
and finished products, and any new product development ingredients or products

• a system to ensure incorrect ingredients cannot be used
• procedures (e.g. cleaning procedures) to prevent cross-contamination from the production 

of one type of pet food into the subsequent pet food for a different species
• specific procedures to ensure correct labelling of intended animal species and any 

limitations on use.

5.8.3 Where the site manufactures, processes or packs pet food or animal feed products that 
contain medicinal substances, the site shall have specific procedures for the management 
of the medicated raw materials and finished products. At a minimum, these procedures shall 
include:

• identification of medication-containing materials handled on site. These can be raw 
materials, processing aids, intermediate and finished products, rework or any new product 
or product development ingredients

• supplier approval equivalent to section 3.5.1 for all medicated raw materials
• specific staff training on the correct handling of medicated materials
• mechanisms to ensure the correct concentrations of medicinal substances in finished 

products
• procedures (e.g. cleaning procedures) to prevent contamination of non-medicated pet 

food or animal feed with materials containing medicinal substances
• specific procedures to ensure the correct labelling of medicated pet food or animal feed
• waste disposal mechanisms (see section 4.12) that include the safe and legal disposal of 

medicated raw materials and products.

Interpretation Medicated products

If a site manufactures pet food and/or animal feed which contains medicinal substances, it is 
vital that these materials (both the raw materials and the finished products) are controlled to 
ensure correct doses and prevent cross-contamination. At a minimum, procedures must:

• ensure clear identification of medicated materials (raw materials, processing aids, 
intermediate products, rework and finished products) throughout the receipt, storage and 
manufacturing processes, so that all staff are aware that the material is medicated and of 
the nature of the medication. This is important where multiple medicated substances are 
handled on site

• include supplier approval in accordance with section 3.5.1 for all medicated raw materials 
(in addition to the other feed ingredients which are already covered in section 3.5.1); for 
example, raw material risk assessments, supplier approval and monitoring procedures

• ensure relevant product safety training, as required by section 7.1 of the Standard. If 
the site handles medicated materials, training must provide specific information on 
the handling of these materials and any relevant procedures specifically related to the 
medicated substances

• include processes to evaluate the correct doses of medicated substances for new product 
development, recipes and specifications

• ensure that only the correct amounts of medicated substances are added to the batch 
during manufacture. Any features of the manufacturing process that could affect these 
concentrations (e.g. uneven distribution through the batch or a production process that 
effectively concentrates the medication such as a cooking process that causes water loss) 
must be considered

Interpretation 
continued

• prevent cross-contamination from the production of medicated pet food into subsequent 
pet food which should not contain the medication. This applies principally to cleaning 
procedures.

Medicated substances and products containing them are likely to be subject to additional 
procedures and legal requirements; for example:

• specific storage requirements
• segregation between medicated and non-medicated materials and products (both in 

storage and during production)
• handling of waste materials in a way that is legal and prevents product contamination 

(as already highlighted in section 4.12). Medicated substances, and products containing 
them, are likely to require specific procedures to ensure safe and legal waste disposal; 
for example, controlled disposal, licensed contractors, prevention of environmental 
contamination.

5.8.4 Site procedures shall be designed and implemented to meet the relevant pet food and 
animal feed product safety legislation (both in the country of production and in the country 
of sale).

Interpretation Legislation

Different parts of the world have different legislative requirements relating to pet food and 
animal feed. For example, in the UK, the production of pet food using materials of animal 
origin and animal by-products needs to be registered with the Animal and Plant Health 
Agency (APHA), and the EU Animal Feed Regulations apply, such as the regulation regarding 
the placing of animal feed on the market.

Clause 1.1.8 requires sites to have systems in place to ensure that they remain up to date with 
product safety legislation (as well as other aspects of good practice). Clause 5.8.4 requires 
that legislation is converted into practice, such that site procedures are designed and 
implemented to meet the legislative requirements in both the country of manufacture and 
the country where the product is sold.

5.9 Animal primary conversion

Where a site completes animal primary conversion (e.g. for red meat, poultry or fish), the following requirements 
apply, in addition to those within the rest of the Standard.

Interpretation

Animal primary conversion is defined as completing the slaughter and/or evisceration of animals (including red meat, 
poultry and game) or the slaughter and/or gutting of fish. Applicable sites will therefore fall within BRCGS product 
categories 1, 2 or 4.

For animal primary conversion, the site shall operate controlled processes that ensure products are safe and fit for 
intended use.

Interpretation

Specific controls are required to ensure that food remains safe, authentic and legal during animal primary conversion.

The clauses in this section are closely linked to clauses in other sections of the Standard and the interpretation 
provided with them.

Clause Requirements
5.9.1 The company shall undertake a risk assessment for potential prohibited substances (i.e. 

those prohibited by legislation in the country of operation or intended country of sale). 
Example substances include pharmaceuticals, veterinary medicines (e.g. growth hormones), 
heavy metals and pesticides.

The risk assessment may be completed as part of clause 3.5.1.1 or as a separate activity.

The results of the risk assessment shall be included in raw material acceptance and testing 
procedures and in the processes adopted for supplier approval and monitoring (see clauses 
3.5.1.2–3.5.2.2).

Interpretation Prohibited substances risk assessment

Many countries have legislation relating to substances that are prohibited in food, and 
specifically meat and products of animal origin. A risk assessment is therefore required to 
assess the risk of raw materials containing these substances.

The Standard does not provide a definitive list of prohibited substances, as this will depend 
on the location of the site and the countries where the products will be sold; however, 
examples include pharmaceuticals, veterinary medicines (such as growth hormones), specific 
heavy metals and pesticides.

This activity may form part of the larger risk assessment completed on all raw materials (see 
clause 3.5.1.1), be completed as part of the HACCP process (see clause 2.7.1) or be completed 
as a separate activity.

Section 3.5.1 requires the company to have supplier approval and monitoring processes, and 
the output from this risk assessment must be included in those activities.

5.9.2 Where the site is in receipt of live animals, there shall be an inspection by a suitably 
competent individual at lairage and post-mortem to ensure that the animals are fit for human 
consumption.

Interpretation Live animal inspection

This requirement relates only to sites that are in receipt of live animals, such as 
slaughterhouses and sites receiving live fish.

The purpose of the inspection is to ensure that the animals are not diseased and are fit for 
slaughter for human consumption.

The inspection must be carried out both before and after slaughter. It should also identify 
any live animals that may present an increased risk of cross-contamination in the plant; for 
example, excessively dirty or salmonella-positive flocks. Such animals require extra actions, 
such as cleaning or slaughter at the end of production, to prevent cross-contamination of 
unaffected animals or products.

In most countries, official veterinary inspections occur before and after slaughter. This fulfils 
the primary requirements of the clause. In the absence of an official veterinary inspection, 
the checks must be carried out by site staff who understand the signs of disease that present 
a risk to human consumption and any legislative requirements, and who have the authority 
to reject animals or organs.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

Where an animal is found to be unfit for human consumption, the site would be expected to 
have procedures in place for the segregation of unfit meat or animals to prevent them from 
entering the human food chain.

Records should be kept of the inspections.

5.9.3 The site shall operate procedures to ensure that the traceability of all edible parts of the 
carcass (i.e. all parts that are intended for the human food supply chain) is maintained.

Interpretation Traceability of all edible parts of the carcasses

The site must operate appropriate procedures to ensure that the traceability of all edible 
parts of the carcass (i.e. those intended for the human food chain) is maintained, including 
blood or other by-products for human consumption.

Similarly to clause 3.9.1, the Standard is not prescriptive on the traceability system used. 
However, the site must be aware of any limitations of the traceability systems used. If a 
carcass is deemed unfit for consumption, all edible parts associated with that carcass need to 
be removed from the product flow. If traceability is to the day or batch rather than to specific 
carcasses, in the event of a product withdrawal or recall, the whole day of production or 
batch may need to be recalled for each edible part.

The site must document its traceability procedure, and ensure relevant personnel are trained 
in it and it is fully implemented.

Note that for the purposes of this clause, edible parts include any part of the carcass which 
enters the human food chain (including offal, animal by-products for human food chain, and 
blood for human consumption; e.g. in the UK, blood is incorporated into the manufacture of 
black pudding).

The site should be aware that in addition to a documented procedure, traceability requires a 
number of activities including identification of raw materials, intermediate/semi-processed 
products, part-used materials, and finished products in accordance with clause 3.9.2.

5.9.4 The site shall establish defined time and temperature requirements for all post-slaughter 
processes (for example, post-slaughter cooling, processing, storage and distribution). These 
requirements shall be defined for all chilled or frozen, edible parts of the carcass.

Interpretation Post-slaughter time and temperature

Clause 6.1.1 requires the site to have documented process specifications and work 
instructions for all key processes that may adversely affect product safety, legality and 
quality. This requirement specifically focuses on the need for post-slaughter times and 
temperatures to ensure product safety. These must be available for:

• all edible parts intended for the human food chain
• all parts of the post-slaughter process including, for example, initial cooling (and time to 

reach intended carcass temperature), any processing stage, storage and distribution.

6.1 Control of operations

Fundamental
The site shall operate to process specifications and work instructions/procedures that ensure the 
production of consistently safe and legal product with the desired quality characteristics, in full 
compliance with the HACCP or food safety plan.

Interpretation

The principle of these requirements is to ensure that the documented HACCP or food safety plan is put into 
operation on a day-to-day basis, together with effective procedures to ensure that the product can be produced:

• to food safety and legality requirements
• consistently to the specified quality.

Note that this section of the Standard covers production facilities. In conjunction with these requirements, sites may 
find it useful to consider sections 4.15 (product storage) and 4.16 (management of transportation/distribution of the 
product).

Clause Requirements
6.1.1 Documented process specifications and work instructions/procedures shall be available 

for the key processes in the production of products to ensure product safety, legality and 
quality. The process specifications and work instructions/procedures (as appropriate) shall 
include:

• recipes – including identification of any allergens
• mixing instructions, speed, time
• equipment process settings
• cooking times and temperatures
• cooling times and temperatures
• labelling instructions
• coding and shelf-life marking
• storage conditions (e.g. storage temperatures)
• any additional critical control points identified in the HACCP or food safety plan.

Process specifications shall be in accordance with the agreed finished product specification.

The site shall review the process specifications and work instructions/procedures prior to 
any changes which may affect food safety, legality and quality.

Interpretation Manufacturing instructions and process specifications

Documented process specifications, procedures or work instructions must be available for 
all key stages of the operation. These documents must be readily available to staff in the 
area in which the activity is undertaken. The documents must be sufficient to ensure that 
all key process parameters are specified and controlled, thereby ensuring that manufactured 
product consistently meets safety, legality and quality specifications.

Interpretation

Note that while some of these key processes are likely to be CCPs or equivalent, they are 
unlikely to be limited to just CCPs, and sites may need to consider other control points 
and prerequisites to ensure all relevant parameters are captured. The Standard lists some 
examples including (although this is not an exhaustive list):

• recipes – including identification of any allergens
• mixing instructions such as speed and time
• equipment process settings; for example, line speed, which may in turn affect other online 

food safety and quality activities such as:
• the performance of metal detectors, check weighers and automated packaging accuracy 

checks
• manual inspection for quality
• cooking, chilling and freezing where this is completed using a continuous production 

line
• cooking times and temperatures
• cooling times and temperatures
• labelling instructions
• coding and shelf-life marking – it is worth noting that product recalls have occurred when 

date codes are incorrectly calculated and incorrect information printed on the pack
• storage conditions (e.g. storage temperatures) for raw materials, intermediates and final 

products
• any additional critical control points identified in the HACCP or food safety plan.

Staff must be trained in the work instructions relevant to their role (section 7.1). 
Manufacturing instructions and process specifications must correctly reflect customer 
requirements, such as final product specifications. The equipment settings must be checked 
to ensure that the equipment is set up correctly for the specific product in production, and 
labelling instructions (such as particular requirements for label positioning on the pack) 
must be followed.

Specifications for work in progress are not applicable to all products. For example, when a 
product is manufactured in several stages and combined to form the final product, or when 
a product is partially processed and retained for future processing, a separate specification 
for that product may be required. It must detail the important criteria that affect the finished 
product quality or safety parameters (e.g. brix, weight, colour, shelf life or storage conditions) 
and must include the acceptable range of each parameter.

Simple photographic specifications, including minimum, target and maximum grading levels 
for parameters such as size and colour, may be appropriate for production staff.

The site must ensure that process specifications and work instructions remain up to date, 
and therefore needs a review process that ensures that documents are updated prior to any 
changes.

6.1.2 Where equipment settings are critical to the safety or legality of the product, changes to 
the equipment settings shall only be completed by trained and authorised staff. Where 
applicable, controls shall be password-protected or otherwise restricted.

Interpretation Equipment settings

As with any electronically stored data or records, equipment settings for product safety and/
or legality should be adjusted only by trained and competent members of staff, and controls 
should be in place to ensure that this remains the case.

Where equipment has the capacity for password protection or other restrictions such as 
locked controls, these should be used to ensure that only trained and authorised staff can 
make the amendments. Where equipment does not include these functions, the site will 
need to identify alternative mechanisms of control.

6.1.3 Process monitoring, such as temperature, time, pressure and chemical properties, shall be 
implemented, adequately controlled and recorded to ensure that product is produced within 
the required process specification.

Interpretation Process monitoring

Processes must be adequately controlled and monitored to ensure that product is produced 
within specification. These processes may include CCPs or prerequisite programmes 
addressing issues such as temperature, time, pressure and chemical properties.

Monitoring must be carried out at suitable frequencies based on experience of the 
reliability of equipment, frequency of process changes, and risk to product safety and 
quality. The frequency of checks should be included on recording forms and/or in procedure 
documentation. A record of all monitoring must be maintained.

Where processes are shown to have exceeded defined limits, corrective actions must be 
taken and this action must be recorded (clause 6.1.6).

6.1.4 In circumstances where process parameters or product quality are controlled by in-line 
monitoring devices, these shall be linked to a suitable failure alert system that is routinely 
tested.

Interpretation In-line monitoring devices

Where process parameters or product quality are controlled by in-line monitoring devices 
(e.g. automatic temperature or pH loggers), they must be linked to a suitable failure alert 
system (e.g. audible/visual alarm, machine stop function or product divert system) which is 
activated when defined parameters are exceeded. This alarm must be tested routinely to 
ensure that it functions properly, and records must be maintained.

6.1.5 Where variation in processing conditions may occur within equipment critical to the safety 
or quality of products, the processing characteristics shall be validated and verified at a 
frequency based on risk and performance of equipment (e.g. heat distribution in retorts, 
ovens and processing vessels; temperature distribution in freezers and cold stores).

Interpretation Critical safety or quality parameters

The objective is to ensure that products can be consistently produced and stored within 
clearly defined parameters (e.g. within defined temperatures). It is recognised that process 
conditions are often not uniform throughout a chill store or an oven. It is important,

Interpretation 
continued

therefore, to identify hot or cold spots, both to try to improve uniformity and to identify 
worst-case scenarios to ensure that all products meet at least the minimum process 
conditions.

The Standard includes some common examples of equipment parameters such as:

• heat distribution in retorts, ovens and processing vessels – the Standard expects heat-
distribution studies to be carried out on cooking equipment wherever small variations in 
process temperature may affect the safety of the products. Heat-distribution studies of a 
static oven may identify cold spots. If it is not possible to make adjustments to eliminate 
these cold spots, the areas should be used as the worst-case scenarios when completing 
heat-distribution studies

• temperature distribution in freezers and cold stores – when assessing whether to 
undertake temperature distribution studies on chill or freezer facilities, the level of 
risk will depend on the product, the time spent in store and any margin allowed by the 
temperature settings (e.g. setting the temperature at −20°C to ensure achievement of 
−18°C). Temperature distribution studies would not normally be necessary for small chill 
or cold stores where product is stored only for short periods.

However, this is not a prescriptive list, and the site should consider all situations where 
variations in processing conditions may occur in equipment critical to the safety or quality 
of products. For example, if pH is identified as critical, it may be necessary to validate the 
pH distribution in a mixing vessel, and consider the thoroughness of the mixing process to 
achieve the desired pH throughout the batch.

When testing equipment, any seasonal variations in performance must be considered, 
especially when trying to assess worst-case scenarios. For example, a chiller evaluated 
in winter may not give the same results in summer, especially if there are large seasonal 
differences in the ambient temperatures. Some refrigeration equipment may be at the 
limit of their performance on especially hot days if temperature parameters have not been 
properly specified.

6.1.6 In the event of equipment failure or deviation of the process from specification, procedures 
shall be in place to establish the safety status and quality of the product to determine the 
action to be taken.

Interpretation Equipment failure and results outside defined limits

In cases of equipment failure or deviation from process or specification (e.g. outside the 
critical limit), the company must have defined procedures in place to ensure that the product 
is safe prior to its release. At a minimum, this should include:

• identification of all products at risk (i.e. product produced since the last satisfactory check)
• how the affected product will be assessed for suitability/safety (this may include sensory 

testing, microbiological sampling, reference to thermal process data or the use of 
mathematical modelling techniques, depending on the product and issue)

• who is authorised to undertake action and make a final decision on the affected product.

Where product safety, authenticity, legality or quality is implicated, the site may need to 
apply its non-conforming product procedures (see section 3.8).

Records must be kept of any deviation and the action taken.

6.1.7 Where a site handles products or materials (e.g. by-products from production processes) 

that are outside the scope of the audit, these shall be controlled to ensure that they do not 
create a product safety, authenticity or legality risk to products within the scope.

Interpretation Exclusions from audit scope

This aim of this requirement is to ensure that the site has considered and managed any 
potential product safety, authenticity and legality risks associated with products or materials 
that are outside of the scope of the BRCGS audit.

During the audit, the auditor may request information or watch the process, to ensure 
procedures are in place and completed appropriately, and therefore do not represent a risk 
to the products within scope.

Examples of products outside of scope include, but are not limited to:

• by-products of the manufacturing process, which are not permitted to be included in the 
scope of the Standard (e.g. materials taken for non-food use)

Fundamental
The management controls of product-labelling activities shall ensure that products will be correctly 
labelled and coded.

Interpretation

One of the common causes of withdrawals and recalls is incorrectly packed products and labelling (e.g. allergen 
labelling) that does not reflect the actual content of the product. Therefore the aim of this section is to ensure that 
the site has effective procedures to manage packing operations and to pack products in the correct packaging.

Packaging controls must be in place which ensure the whole packing process is documented and working effectively. 
These controls must be managed by nominated staff who have received specific labelling and packing process 
training (see clause 7.1.5).

Sites may find it beneficial to consider this section in conjunction with sections 5.2 (product labelling) and 5.5 
(product packaging), which detail requirements on the design and purchase of packaging and labels.

Clause Requirements
6.2.1 There shall be a formal process for the allocation of packaging materials to packing lines 

and control in the packing area which ensures that only the packaging for immediate use is 
available to the packing machines.

Where offline coding or printing of packaging materials occurs:

• setting and amendments to the printer parameters (e.g. the input of, or changes to, date 
codes) shall only be completed by an authorised member of staff

• controls shall be in place to ensure that only correctly printed material is available at the 
packing machines.

Processes shall be in place to check label use is reconciled with expected use and the cause 
of any inconsistencies investigated.

Interpretation Allocation of packaging materials

Packaging for each production run must be brought to the line in a formal and controlled 
manner following a documented process.

Only the packaging required for immediate use should be available to the packing line at 
any one time. Ideally, this will be achieved by only releasing new packaging from the store 
when all packaging from the previous run has been removed from the area. Where this is not 
possible (e.g. because of off-site packaging stores), a mechanism must be in place to ensure 
that only the relevant packaging can be released to the packing line (e.g. by storing packaging 
in a designated, secure location with authorised access).

Where multiple component packaging is used (e.g. pots with separate lids, multi-packs or 
packaging with separate labels), then the controls will need to apply to all the individual 
parts, to ensure they all match the product being produced.

The integrity of date codes is vital to ensure product safety is maintained. Where date codes 
(or other information) are applied to packaging or product on site (e.g. on the trays, sleeves 
or flow wraps), this must be controlled so that only authorised (and competent) personnel 
can set or make the changes to printers (e.g. inputting the required date code).

Processes must be in place to ensure that, after the product run, any unused labels are 
removed from the packaging line.

Checks must be in place to monitor that actual label use matches expected label use (i.e. the 
actual and expected uses are reconciled). The aim is to confirm correct usage, and therefore 
provide an opportunity for any inconsistencies or unexpected results to be investigated. The 
Standard is not prescriptive on how this is completed; however, the site may find it useful to 
consider:

• the typical waste tolerance, i.e. how many labels are typically wasted or destroyed during a 
production run (this allows normal waste figures to be included in the reconciliation)

• the number of labels received, issued, used or restocked, along with any obsolete, 
misprinted or destroyed labels that need to be accounted for

• systems for recording packing information; for example, when new reels or new batches of 
labels are added to the line

• the frequency of the checks – for most sites, this is likely to be at the end of each 
production run, as this allows investigation of any inconsistences while the product is still 
within the site’s control. However, there may be situations, for example, with very long 
production runs, where an alternative frequency is justified

• the system to be used to complete the check; for example, an automated label check and 
accounting system or a manual check system could be used, either of which might take the 
form of a formal mass balance at the end of each production run, or of a stock take.

Any inconsistencies or unexpected results must be investigated to ensure correct label use. 
Where appropriate, non-conforming product procedures (see section 3.8), corrective action, 
root cause analysis and preventive actions may be required (see section 3.7).

6.2.2 Documented checks of the production line shall be carried out before commencing 
production and following changes of product. These shall ensure that lines have been 
suitably cleared and are ready for production. Documented checks shall be carried out 
at product changes to ensure that all products and printed packaging and labels from 
the previous production have been removed from the line before changing to the next 
production.

Interpretation Production line checks

Sites are required to manage product changeovers and line start-ups to ensure the line is 
ready and correctly set for the next production run. If changeover is completed incorrectly, 
this represents a weakness at a key point in the production process, which could result in 
the production of non-conforming products; for example:

• incorrect products being packed
• incorrect labels being used (a major cause of product withdrawals and recalls in several 

parts of the world)
• insufficient cleaning between products, resulting in:

• the potential for microbiological or allergen cross-contamination
• quality issues related to the product being contaminated or tainted with previous 

products
• incorrect process parameters being used, e.g. cooking times and temperatures, or incorrect 

date coding.

Documented checks carried out on the production line before production commences 
must therefore ensure that systems are correctly set and running. Checks must include 
confirmation that:

• lines have been suitably cleaned
• lines have been cleared of any packaging from previous production runs
• lines are ready for production, with CCPs and quality parameters correctly set (e.g. 

metal detector checks completed satisfactorily, cookers set to the correct temperature 
programme, correct packaging selected).

If the line is set up with equipment that has not been used for some time, there may be a 
need to re-disinfect food contact surfaces immediately prior to use, or undertake additional 
line checks, to ensure appropriate set-up (for example, that condition monitoring has been 
completed and the correct operating settings selected).

Checks are also required following changes of product to ensure that all product, packaging 
and labels from the previous production have been removed and, where appropriate, to 
ensure that both cleaning and line set-up have been completed correctly for the new 
product. Line checks are usually the responsibility of the line manager or supervisor. 
Evidence that checks have been carried out (e.g. line check sheets) and guidelines on the 
checks to complete should be available.

During the audit, the auditor will normally expect to witness at least one product 
changeover, and wherever practical at least one line start-up. There may be exceptional 
circumstances where a site has very long production runs, or situations where there are no 
scheduled product changeovers during the audit (as when the length of the production run 
is longer than the number of days that the auditor is on site), and therefore the inclusion of 
a product changeover or a line start-up is not possible; however, this must be considered 
exceptional, and any exceptions or omissions will be detailed in the audit report.

6.2.3 Procedures shall be in place to ensure that all products are packed into the correct 
packaging and correctly labelled. These shall include checks:

• at the start of packing
• during the packing run (e.g. at predefined intervals and when printed packaging or labels 

are brought to the line during the production run)
• when changing batches of packaging materials at the end of each production run.

The checks shall also include verification of any printing carried out at the packing stage 
including, as appropriate:

• date coding
• batch coding
• quantity indication
• pricing information
• bar coding
• country of origin
• allergen information.

Interpretation Packaging controls

A high proportion of product withdrawals/recalls are because of products being packed 
into incorrect packaging or incorrectly labelled. Therefore, specific documented packaging 
controls must be in place. Particular care is required where:

• a number of similar-looking products are manufactured
• a standard product may be packed into different types of packaging
• there is a family of very similar labels for a product range, each containing different 

information (e.g. the presence of different allergens or different use-by/best-before dates).

Procedures must be in place to verify that adequate checks have been carried out to 
minimise potential errors. The frequency of checks must be predefined, based on risk 
assessment, but at a minimum those checks specified in the requirement must be included:

• at the start of packing – this is especially useful to confirm the correct packaging and 
labels are being used, and that line changeover procedures (clause 6.2.2) have effectively 
removed all labels from the previous run

• during the packing run (i.e. at predefined intervals); for example, the risk assessment 
may have identified a maximum frequency based on previous experience, or a maximum 
amount of product based on the site’s ability to recover and check product in the event of 
a failure

• when changing batches of packaging materials; for example, when each new reel of labels 
or new batch of packaging is added to the line

• at the end of each production run.

The packing run can be defined as a batch or lot (e.g. each time a new reel is used), or 
another distinct period. The intention is to ensure that the site is maintaining control over 
pre-printed packaging materials and their packing.

The procedures must also include verification of any code information or other printing 
carried out at the packing stage (i.e. applied by the site). This verification shall include those 
checks as specified in the requirement.

Packaging and label checks should be recorded.

6.2.4 Where online verification equipment (e.g. bar code scanners) is used to check product labels 
and printing, the site shall establish and implement procedures for the operation and testing 
of the equipment to ensure that the system is correctly set up and capable of alerting or 
rejecting product when packaging information is out of specification.

At a minimum, testing of the equipment shall be completed at:

• the start of the packing run
• the end of the packing run
• a frequency based on the site’s ability to identify, hold and prevent the release of any 

implicated materials should the equipment fail (e.g. during the packing run or when 
changing batches of packaging materials).

The site shall establish and implement procedures in the event of a failure in the online 
verification equipment (e.g. a documented and trained manual checking procedure).

Interpretation Online vision equipment

Some sites have found that the use of automated online vision equipment (e.g. bar code 
scanners or cameras) provides a beneficial check of the accuracy of the packing operation. 
This equipment is able to check that the correct packaging has been consistently used 
throughout the packing run and that the correct date code has been applied. Any out-
of-specification information (as when the wrong packaging is used) is identified by this 
equipment, and staff are either alerted or the product is rejected out of the product flow.

Where a company chooses to use this type of equipment, it is important that procedures are 
in place to ensure that it is correctly set up and operates effectively throughout the packing 
run. At a minimum this will include checks:

• at the beginning of the packing run, so that the equipment is confirmed to be set up 
correctly before packing commences

• at the end of the packing run, to confirm that the equipment is still operating effectively 
when packing is completed

Interpretation 
continued

• during the packing run, at a frequency based on risk (i.e. based on the site’s ability to take 
appropriate action in the event of an adverse test result, before the implicated materials 
are released from the site).

Depending on the function of the vision system, incorrect packaging might include the 
wrong packaging, an incorrect date code or an obscured label.

Due to the variations in the different types of online vision equipment, the testing 
procedures are not prescribed in the Standard. However, where the verification equipment 
exists as a separate item of equipment (situated, for example, towards the end of a 
production line, similar to the common placement of metal detectors), good practice is to 
test the system using incorrect packs to ensure that the equipment identifies and rejects 
those packs. It is important that these test packs are clearly marked so that they cannot 
inadvertently enter the process flow. The method can be used to check each function of the 
equipment (e.g. detection system, rejection mechanism or line stop, authorised restart and 
mis-read/non-read alarm).

However, where the verification equipment is integral to another piece of equipment on 
the packing line (e.g. based on cameras or scanners built into the printer, or printed film 
roll dispensers), or is situated where packaging is constructed (e.g. where cardboard boxes 
are glued immediately prior to the camera), it may not be possible, or practical, to insert 
incorrect packaging as a means of testing. In these situations, the site may devise alternative 
testing solutions. For example, before the packing run begins, a test programme could check 
each function of the verification equipment by causing the instrument to reject the existing/
correct packaging.

The site must consider the procedures it would follow in the event of an equipment failure 
(e.g. a backup plan).

6.3 Quantity – weight, volume and number control

The site shall operate a quantity control system which conforms to legal requirements in the country where the 
product is sold and any additional industry sector codes or specified customer requirements.

The type of quantity control used (e.g. average weights, catch weight, minimum weight or 
count) may be determined by the company in conjunction with the requirements of the 
customer.

The system used must operate to the legal requirements in the country, state or territory in

Potential changes during transport and shelf life (e.g. weight loss during transport or water 
loss (desiccation) during storage) may need to be factored in, so that the weight at the end of 
shelf life continues to meet statutory and customer requirements.

Adequate records must be kept or, where automatic check-weighing equipment is used, 
this must be properly set up and the rejection system tested according to industry-sector 
guidelines. Checks of automatic reject systems must be carried out using representative 
packs of the product being produced.

The colour-coding of the clause indicates that it should be audited during on-site audits of 
production areas where the equipment is located, as the auditor will normally expect to see 
the process in operation, and not just a review of records.

6.3.2 Where the quantity of the product is not governed by legislative requirements (e.g. bulk 
quantity), the product shall conform to customer requirements and records shall be 
maintained.

Interpretation Quantity control – customer requirements

Where there are no legislative requirements (e.g. where bulk quantities are supplied to the 
customer), procedures must be in place to ensure that customer requirements are met (e.g. 
monitoring by flow meter or calibrated weighbridge for tanker loads).

Good practice is to ensure that the customer requirements are clearly defined; for example, 
in a specification or buying contract.

Records must be maintained.

6.3.3 Where used, the site shall establish procedures for the operation and testing of online check 
weighers. At a minimum, this shall include:

• consideration of any legal requirements
• responsibilities for testing the equipment
• operating effectiveness and any variations for particular products
• methods and frequency of testing the check weighers
• processes for handling rejected packs
• records of the test results.

Interpretation Online check weighers

A check weigher is defined as automated equipment for checking that the weight of 
products is correct and within relevant limits (e.g. it meets legislative and customer limits).

The equipment must be sufficiently rigorous for the intended purpose. For example, a check 
weigher that is simply used to provide a rough check during production is likely to be less 
critical to product legality than one used to verify legal compliance of a final product.

The effective operation of a check weigher must be verified within the context of legal 
requirements (e.g. minimum fill weights against declaration), and its function must be assured 
through testing and operation.

The Standard lists the minimum items that the site procedures will need to include:

• consideration of any legal requirements – depending on the product and the legislation in 
the country of sale, this might include minimum weight, average weight, maximum weight 
(for example, if large portion size affects minimum cooking times for food safety) etc.

• methods, frequency and responsibilities for testing the equipment – the method of testing 
the check weigher; the actions to take if it fails the test; how frequently the tests are 
completed and the staff responsible for completing them. In accordance with section 7.1, 
staff will need to be trained in the correct procedures

• operating effectiveness and any variations for particular products (e.g. any known and 
permitted variations)

• processes for handling rejected packs; for example, ensuring underweight packs are 
removed and do not re-enter the product flow, procedures indicating whether packs can 
be opened and the content returned to the product flow, any investigation needed as a 
result of rejected packs

• records of the test results.

Clause 6.4.1 details the requirement for calibration of measuring equipment, which includes 
check weighers.

The methodology of testing should be documented, and the operator or person with 
responsibility for the check weigher should understand the expected output and frequency.

Particular consideration should be given to the location of the check weigher to ensure 
that results accurately reflect the batch of product leaving the site. For example, if the site 
locates metal detectors, or sampling points after the check weigher, it may need to consider 
the implications of the removal of product by those systems on, for example, average weight 
calculations.

6.4 Calibration and control of measuring and monitoring devices

The site shall be able to demonstrate that measuring equipment is sufficiently accurate and reliable to provide 
confidence in measurement results.

Interpretation

The site must ensure that key pieces of equipment that control and monitor processes are themselves confirmed 
as operating effectively and accurately. This is routinely confirmed by measurement against recognised standards. 
Where national or international standards do not exist, the company needs to demonstrate how the equipment is 
adequately monitored.

Clause Requirements
6.4.1 The site shall identify and control measuring equipment used to monitor critical control 

points and product safety, legality and quality. This shall include, at a minimum:

• a documented list of equipment and its location
• an identification code and calibration due date
• prevention from adjustment by unauthorised staff
• protection from damage, deterioration or misuse.

Interpretation Identification and control of measuring equipment

The site needs to identify the measuring equipment (e.g. scales, thermometers and pH 
meters) that is used to monitor CCPs, product safety, legality and quality.

At a minimum, this equipment must be:

• documented in a list which details the location of each item of equipment
• marked in accordance with its calibration requirements; for example, with an identification 

code and the calibration due date. This may be achieved by engraving the piece of 
equipment with a number that cross-references to the documented list, or labelling the 
equipment with its calibration due date. Where equipment (e.g. a pH meter) is calibrated 
daily or more frequently, this could be addressed by a procedure that clearly states the 
frequency of calibration and a record of the daily calibration activities

• protected against unauthorised adjustment (e.g. through the use of programme ID codes 
or locking keys)

• protected from damage or misuse through good design or the training of staff.

6.4.2 All identified measuring devices, including new equipment, shall be checked and, where 
necessary, adjusted:

• at a predetermined frequency, based on risk assessment
• to a defined method traceable to a recognised national or international standard where 

possible.

Results shall be documented. Equipment shall be readable and be of a suitable accuracy for 
the measurements it is required to perform.

Interpretation Calibration checks

The site needs to establish the method by which the precision and accuracy of equipment is 
verified. This must include:

• a predefined check frequency, based on a risk assessment (e.g. historical reliability, nature 
of use, manufacturer’s recommendations)

• who is authorised to complete the checks (e.g. trained staff)
• the method to be used (which must, where possible, be traceable to a recognised standard, 

e.g. use of a master calibration thermometer that has a certified test certificate traceable to 
a national standard).

Equipment must be of a suitable accuracy for the measurements it is required to perform. 
For example, where temperature is critical to the safety of a product (as in pasteurisation or 
the canning process), the measuring thermometer requires an accuracy of ±0.5°C, whereas a 
thermometer used to check vehicle temperatures may only need an accuracy of ±1°C.

6.4.3 Reference measuring equipment shall be calibrated and traceable to a recognised national 
or international standard and records maintained. The uncertainty of calibration shall be 
considered when equipment is used to assess critical limits.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Reference equipment

All reference equipment (e.g. a master thermometer) must be calibrated and traceable to a 
national or international standard.

Where equipment is used to measure or monitor a critical limit, it is important that the 
tolerance (or uncertainty) of the calibration is considered. For example, if a thermometer 
is required to measure a critical limit of 72°C, but the calibration shows an uncertainty 
of 0.5°C, then a thermometer reading of exactly 72°C could in fact represent a true 
temperature of anywhere between 71.5 and 72.5°C (i.e. the temperature could be lower or 
higher than the critical limit). In this situation, to guarantee a minimum temperature of 72°C, 
it would be necessary for the reading on the thermometer to always be 72.5°C or higher.

Records must be kept.

6.4.4 Procedures shall be in place to record actions to be taken when the prescribed measuring 
devices are found not to be operating within specified limits. Where the safety or legality of 
products is based on equipment found to be inaccurate, action shall be taken to ensure at-
risk product is not offered for sale.

Interpretation Equipment outside specified limits

Documented procedures must detail the action to be taken when equipment is found to be 
outside specified limits. The documentation must specify what will be done and by whom, 
and must include what will happen to products that have been monitored by this equipment 
since the last successful check (to prevent at-risk products from being offered for sale).

Records must be kept of the actions taken.

7 Personnel

7.1 Training: raw material-handling, preparation, processing, packing and storage areas

Fundamental
The company shall ensure that all personnel performing work that affects product safety, legality and 
quality are demonstrably competent to carry out their activity, through training, work experience or 
qualification.

Interpretation

Training is a fundamental requirement of the Standard, as without properly trained and competent staff, it is unlikely 
that product safety, authenticity, legality or quality procedures can be completed in a rigorous and consistent 
manner. Staff must therefore have the knowledge and skills to undertake their role, and must understand the impact 
their actions will make.

Companies must ensure that all training is up to date, covering relevant product safety, legality and quality 
requirements.

Seasonal/temporary personnel and contractors must be included. Where employment agencies are used for the 
provision of staff, all the requirements in this section need to be adequately met and evidenced. This may include:

• specifying company policies within any supply contract
• obtaining evidence of staff training records from the agency prior to a staff member commencing work
• using a risk-based system to challenge staff understanding and ensure competence in carrying out roles.

Employment agencies are subcontracted service providers whose business is to assist companies in filling vacant 
positions. Agency staff are often used to fill temporary positions, such as those caused by seasonal variations in 
production.

Clause Requirements
7.1.1 All personnel, including agency-supplied staff, temporary staff and contractors, shall be 

appropriately trained prior to commencing work and adequately supervised throughout the 
working period.

Interpretation Initial training and supervision

The company must ensure that all staff, including temporary staff, agency-supplied staff (see 
statement of intent) and contractors, receive training.

All staff will need some level of training; this should be proportional to their responsibility 
and the type of work or activity they perform. The company is responsible for defining the 
training requirements appropriate for each specific role (see clause 7.1.3).

For example, the following training options may be considered:

• induction training for all staff, covering company policies on hygiene, allergen awareness 
(see clause 7.1.4), quality requirements, entry and exit procedures, pest control, a basic 
introduction to HACCP, etc.

• obtaining a qualification in ‘basic food hygiene’ for food handlers

Interpretation 
continued

• training in areas that impact food safety, such as cleaning, machine operation, quality 
inspections and sampling

• CCP monitoring (see clause 7.1.2).

All personnel must be adequately supervised throughout the working period. Particular 
attention should be paid to identifying the needs of temporary/seasonal workers and 
contractors. Good practice is for new starters to have additional supervision for a defined 
period. This additional supervision can be reduced or removed at the end of the period 
following a review of the employee’s competency to complete the role (see clause 7.1.7).

7.1.2 Where personnel are engaged in activities relating to control measures and critical control 
points, relevant training and competency assessment shall be in place.

Interpretation Critical control point training

To ensure that activities identified as either control measures or critical control points 
(CCPs) within the food safety plan or HACCP are managed correctly, personnel involved 
in these areas must be appropriately trained in the relevant procedure. This includes the 
operation of the control and monitoring activities and the implementation of corrective 
action. Clear, documented instructions must be available, detailing:

• how to carry out the tasks
• when the tasks are to be completed
• records to be maintained
• action to be taken in the event of a non-conforming result.

A competency assessment must take place on completion of the training and at predefined 
intervals (see clause 7.1.7) (e.g. during internal audits of CCPs). The assessment needs to 
confirm that the procedure is being followed correctly, test knowledge of the corrective 
actions, and check for the completion of any relevant training.

7.1.3 The site shall put in place documented programmes covering the training needs of 
personnel. These shall include, at a minimum:

• identifying the necessary competencies for specific roles
• providing training or other action to ensure staff have the necessary competencies
• reviewing the effectiveness of training
• delivery of training in the appropriate language for trainees.

Interpretation Documented training programme

The site must have a documented training programme showing what job role competencies 
are required, including activities related to food safety, authenticity, legality and quality; 
the actions taken to ensure that staff obtain these competencies; and a review of the 
effectiveness of these actions. For example, a job training matrix could list all of the site 
roles, with details of which procedures and work instructions are required for each role.

Training must be delivered in an appropriate language for the trainee (e.g. by providing 
either written or oral translation where it is required). It is not a requirement for all 
documentation to be translated into every language of the workforce, but all staff must be 
able to understand the instructions necessary for their job. For example, hygiene rules may 
be provided in written translations or in pictorial format, while CCP monitoring instructions 
may be translated into the languages spoken by the staff involved in these areas.

The Standard is not prescriptive on the format of the training, and may, for example, include:

• internal training provided by the site
• one-to-one training
• on-the-job training
• external training courses
• computer-based training (CBT)
• training provided by employment agencies, prior to the agency-supplied staff commencing 

roles at the site. (In this situation, the site will need to ensure that the agency has the 
necessary knowledge and training in order to subsequently train staff supplied to the site.)

Training may be delivered internally or externally, but the company needs to ensure that the 
training has been effective. This can be achieved through assessment of the staff’s ability 
to undertake the tasks they need to perform, by testing their knowledge or by on-the-job 
assessment.

A review of training and assessment of its effectiveness is an important part of the process, 
to ensure that it has achieved the level of learning, understanding or competency required. 
Where tests of knowledge are used, good practice is to follow these with a review of any 
areas that were not answered correctly, to ensure that the trainee understands these areas. 
This is particularly important where product safety or legality could be implicated if the 
activity was completed incorrectly.

7.1.4 All personnel, including engineers, agency-supplied staff, temporary staff and contractors, 
shall have received general allergen awareness training and be trained in the site’s allergen-
handling procedures.

Interpretation Allergen training

All personnel, including all agency-supplied staff, temporary staff and contractors, involved 
in handling materials (ingredients, equipment, utensils, packaging and products), must have 
received training to raise awareness of food allergens and the specific allergen measures 
used by the company.

The level of training should be appropriate to the individual’s role. For example:

• Personnel who do not actively handle allergens may require only a general understanding 
of the importance of allergens (for example, simple allergen awareness training, which 
could be included as part of the induction process).

• Those involved in tasks critical to the safety of the product need additional training on 
specific procedures in which they are involved.

• The management team responsible for incidents require a more in-depth knowledge.
• Personnel who develop the allergen management system, and therefore are the site’s 

subject matter experts, require the highest level of training.

All training records must be kept.

7.1.5 All relevant personnel (including relevant agency-supplied staff, temporary staff and 
contractors) shall have received training on the site’s labelling and packing processes which 
are designed to ensure the correct labelling and packing of products.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Packing and labelling training

Mis-packed and mis-labelled goods are the leading cause of product recalls across the 
world.

This clause requires any personnel linked to the packing or labelling of raw materials, 
intermediates or finished product to be trained in, and kept up to date with, proper 
procedures. It is also useful for these staff to understand the implications of mis-packed or 
mis-labelled product.

7.1.6 Records of all training shall be available. These shall include, at a minimum:

• the name of the trainee and confirmation of attendance
• the date and duration of the training
• the title or course contents, as appropriate
• the training provider
• for internal courses, a reference to the material, work instruction or procedure that is used 

in the training.

Where training is undertaken by agencies on behalf of the company, records of the training 
shall be available.

Interpretation Training records

Evidence of all training needs to be kept and must include all the details as listed in the 
requirement.

These details may be included in the certificate of attendance provided at an external or 
internal course, or the course contents may be included in a personnel induction booklet 
that is cross-referenced with a record of the training completed (with trainee name, date and 
name of trainer, together with the name of any translator).

Where training is internal, the site should retain reference to the material used (e.g. to 
the company procedure and its version number). Where the site has used ‘on-the-job’ or 
informal training methods (e.g. toolbox talks), a summary of the content could be used and 
made available for reference.

Training records for any temporary agency-supplied staff and/or external consultants must 
also be available.

7.1.7 The company shall routinely review the competencies of its staff. As appropriate, it shall 
provide relevant training. This may be in the form of training, refresher training, coaching, 
mentoring or on-the-job experience.

Interpretation Competency review

The company must ensure there is ongoing assessment of staff competencies in their roles 
(e.g. through one-to-one appraisals, team performance monitoring by line managers, review 
of the results of internal audits, or review of records).

Where the need is identified (e.g. when a job role changes; following performance issues; 
or when there are changes in operating procedures such as a change in the requirements 
for a CCP), there must be appropriate refresher training (supplied internally or externally), 
coaching, mentoring or on-the-job experience to improve skills and understanding.

The site should determine the appropriate frequency for reviews of competency and training 
needs. There are likely to be several different scenarios; for example:

• a routine review process (e.g. linked to annual performance reviews)
• change management (e.g. when a procedure is amended or updated)
• whenever there is evidence that an update would be beneficial.

7.2 Personal hygiene: raw material-handling, preparation, processing, packing and 
storage areas

The site’s personal hygiene standards shall be developed to minimise the risk of product contamination from 
personnel, be appropriate to the products produced and be adopted by all personnel, including agency-supplied 
staff, contractors and visitors to the production facility.

Interpretation

The site must have documented personal hygiene rules designed to prevent product contamination from personnel. 
These should be based on risk and may take into account different requirements for different production risk zones, 
and any national or regional legislation.

All personnel, including agency-supplied staff, contractors and visitors entering production areas (including raw 
material storage, preparation, processing, packing and storage areas), must adhere to the company’s documented 
personal hygiene rules, including those regarding personal belongings, hand-washing, injuries, illness and medication.

Clause Requirements
7.2.1 The requirements for personal hygiene shall be documented and communicated to all 

personnel. These shall include, at a minimum, the following:

• watches and similar wearable devices shall not be worn
• jewellery shall not be worn, with the exception of a single, plain wedding ring, wedding 

wristband or medical alert jewellery
• rings and studs in exposed parts of the body, such as ears, noses and eyebrows, shall not be 

worn
• fingernails shall be kept short, clean and unvarnished
• false fingernails and nail art shall not be permitted
• excessive perfume or aftershave shall not be worn.

Compliance with the requirements shall be checked routinely.

Interpretation Documented personal hygiene policy

This clause is designed to ensure that personal items are not a source of product 
contamination; for example, small parts that may fall off and become foreign-body hazards, 
or a source of microbiological or allergen contamination (e.g. if the items were previously 
worn in an area that was contaminated and the contaminant was transferred into the 
production area).

The site must document its personal hygiene requirements. At a minimum, these must include:

• Watches are not permitted in open product areas (including devices used for fitness 
monitoring and tracking). It is good practice to include details for all portable personal

items within site policies; for example, mobile phones and tablet devices (e.g. the site 
might exclude all individuals’ personal mobile phones, but have specific rules relating to 
company-issued equipment, which could, for example, include instructions for cleaning on 
entry to production areas).

• Jewellery must not be worn apart from plain, smooth rings or wristbands (i.e. without 
stones that may fall out), such as wedding rings. Exceptions must be minimal and must 
not constitute a risk to product (e.g. wristbands identifying a particular medical condition, 
such as epilepsy or an allergy, may be worn where product is not at risk of contamination). 
Where religious reasons prevent the removal of an item of jewellery, it must be covered 
and the site must complete a risk assessment to determine how this will be achieved (e.g. 
by totally covering the item with the wearer’s clothing, or by wearing overalls that are 
buttoned up to cover the item).

• The potential for broken, damaged or lost glasses and contact lenses to become a foreign-
body risk should be considered.

• Rings and studs must not be worn in exposed parts of the body such as ears, noses, 
eyebrows and tongues.

• Long fingernails are not permitted, as they are a contamination hazard since they 
may break off; nor are nail varnish, nail art or false nails. Fingernails must be kept 
clean, commensurate with the level of hygiene expected within a food manufacturing 
environment. Where visitors cannot comply with these rules, other controls (such as 
limiting where visitors may enter and what they may touch, and the obligatory use of 
gloves) must be implemented to minimise the risk of contamination.

• Excessive perfume or aftershave must not be worn, as this has the potential to taint foods.

These requirements are applicable to raw-material handling, preparation, processing, packing 
and storage areas. The requirements for staff working solely in enclosed product areas may 
be relaxed where no risk is presented to the products.

The requirements must be communicated to all personnel (e.g. through induction training 
and sign-in procedures for visitors and contractors). Consideration must be given to the 
language in which the training is completed; for example, where employees will be working 
in their second or third language. Appropriate methods of training (e.g. use of translators) 
must be provided for them.

Compliance with requirements must be checked regularly; for example, by incorporating 
checks into daily or weekly good manufacturing practice audits (see clause 3.4.4), or through 
the questioning of personnel at regular intervals.

7.2.2 Hand-washing shall be performed on entry to the production areas and at a frequency that is 
appropriate to minimise the risk of product contamination.

Interpretation Hand-washing

Hand-washing must be conducted at a frequency appropriate to the level of risk to the 
product being produced and in line with good industry practice. At a minimum, hands must 
be washed before staff enter the production area and whenever an activity is undertaken 
that could potentially be a risk to products (e.g. after going to the toilet, eating, smoking, 
blowing noses, sneezing or handling shoes).

Appropriate instructions for hand-washing, considering the language needs of staff (e.g. 
including pictorial instructions), must be provided (clause 4.8.4).

Further guidance Introduction to hand-washing techniques

Hand-washing is recognised as an effective way to reduce the risk of contaminating food 
with micro-organisms such as E. coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. However, a 
number of studies have shown that people either do not wash their hands or fail to clean 
them effectively. So it is vital that food companies not only provide staff with appropriate 
facilities to wash their hands but also ensure staff are aware of the correct procedure to 
follow.

What makes a good hand-washing procedure?

Frequency

Hand-washing should be carried out as often as is appropriate for the level of risk to the 
product. At a minimum hands should be washed:

• before entering production areas
• after any break which involves leaving the production area
• after going to the toilet
• after eating or smoking
• after blowing your nose.

See also clause 8.4.1 for hand-washing facilities and procedures in high-risk and high-care 
zones.

Method

There are a number of steps in an effective hand-washing procedure:

• wet hands with water
• apply soap
• rub the hands so that all the parts of the hands are cleaned, including palms, backs of 

hands, between fingers, backs of fingers, thumbs and fingertips
• rinse hands to remove soap
• dry hands thoroughly, as careful drying is a vital step in preventing the contamination of 

food products.

For a pictorial example of best practice for hand-washing, visit the World Health 
Organization’s ‘How to Handwash?’ page.

In addition to the above routine, good practice is to apply a sanitiser such as an anti-
bacterial hand gel after the hands have been washed and dried. An effective hand-washing 
routine should take approximately 40–60 seconds to complete.

Training

It is important that a good hygiene culture operates within the site so that an effective 
hand-washing routine becomes normal, everyday behaviour. This means that all new staff 
should be trained (e.g. during induction training) in the site’s hand-cleaning procedures 
and understand the importance of them. Regular updates can help ensure the information 
remains fresh in people’s minds.

Facilities

For a description of hand-washing facilities, see the guidance for clause 4.8.4.

Clause Requirements
7.2.3 All cuts and grazes on exposed skin shall be covered by an appropriately coloured plaster 

that is different from the product colour (preferably blue) and contains a metal detectable 
strip. These shall be site-issued and monitored. Where appropriate, in addition to the plaster, 
a glove shall be worn.

Interpretation Cuts and grazes

Cuts and grazes on exposed areas of skin must be covered to prevent contamination of 
product. To minimise the potential for plasters or band-aids to contaminate product, they 
must be controlled by the site (e.g. through the use of an issue procedure, where numbered 
plasters or band-aids are documented in a log, stating when and to whom they were issued). 
The site may consider the need for an audit of plasters at the end of the shift, and for staff to 
immediately inform supervisors of any loss.

Plasters or band-aids must be visually distinct (preferably blue) and include a metal 
detectable strip. This applies even where the site does not use metal detectors, as many 
products are sold for further processing and the plaster or band-aid could therefore be 
detected at a later stage in the supply chain. Where appropriate, in addition to the plaster or 
band-aid, a glove must be worn.

7.2.4 Where metal detection equipment is used, a sample from each batch of plasters shall be 
successfully tested through the equipment and records shall be kept.

Interpretation Metal detectable plasters

To ensure that each batch of plasters purchased fulfils the metal detectable requirement, 
a sample from each batch must be tested to confirm that it is successfully rejected by the 
metal detector in use.

If multiple metal detectors are used on site, it is good practice to use a risk assessment 
to identify the least sensitive detector, as using this will ensure that a lost plaster can be 
detected by all of the detectors on site.

Records must be kept.

Where the site does not use metal detectors, this requirement (for keeping a sample of the 
batch of plasters) will not apply.

7.2.5 Processes and written instructions for staff shall be in place to control the use and storage 
of personal medicines, so as to minimise the risk of product contamination.

Interpretation Personal medicines

Personal medicines need to be controlled to ensure they do not constitute a risk to product. 
The site must have a documented procedure on the control and storage of medicines.

Wherever possible, medicines should not be taken into production areas (e.g. they could be 
stored in lockers along with other personal items). However, where staff have a medical need 
to keep personal medicines with them (e.g. they have asthma or diabetes), procedures must 
be in place to control these medicines (such as a requirement to notify the company of the 
defined medical need). Consideration should be given to the format and packaging of the 
medicines (e.g. glass bottles) to minimise the potential risk of product contamination.

7.3 Medical screening

The company shall have procedures in place to ensure that staff, agency staff, contractors or visitors are not a 
source of transmission of infections, diseases (including food-borne diseases) or conditions to products.

Interpretation

To ensure that all persons who will come into contact with food production and storage areas are not the source 
of a hazard, the company must have procedures in place by which staff and visitors are fully informed of the health 
conditions and symptoms which prevent them from working in food production and storage areas.

Clause Requirements
7.3.1 The site shall make staff aware of the symptoms of infection, disease or condition which 

would prevent a person working with open food. The site shall have a procedure which 
enables notification by staff (including temporary employees), contractors and visitors to the 
site, of any relevant symptoms, infection, disease or condition which they may have been in 
contact with or may be suffering from.

Interpretation Illness notification procedures

Personnel need to receive, as part of their training, clear instructions on the potential risks of 
food-borne disease and the site’s procedures for illness notification. Staff who are suffering 
from symptoms which may place products at risk must be prevented from working with open 
food.

The site must be expected to define the symptoms, infections or conditions of concern, as 
advised by local legislation (e.g. a list of communicable diseases). These policies must be 
documented.

This requirement covers all personnel on site, including temporary staff and those employed 
via an employment agency. The site may consider the use of a pre-employment and/
or return-to-work medical questionnaire or medical examination (e.g. stool testing), as 
appropriate to the risk.

The use of suitably trained and competent persons and external medical experts may be 
required, particularly where privacy laws exist.

Some countries have legislation relating to fitness to work with food or the handling of 
personal information. Sites are therefore expected to operate in accordance with these 
legislative requirements. For example, in the UK, guidance can be found in the FSA guide 
‘Food Handlers: Fitness to Work – Regulatory Guidance and Best Practice Advice For Food 
Business Operators’.

7.3.2 Where there may be a risk to product safety, visitors and contractors shall be made aware of 
the types of symptoms, infection, disease or condition which would prevent a person visiting 
areas with open food. Where permitted by law, visitors shall be required to complete a health 
questionnaire or otherwise confirm that they are not suffering from any symptoms which 
may put product safety at risk, prior to entering the raw material, preparation, processing, 
packing and storage areas.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Illness notification procedures for visitors to the site

The site must ensure that visitors and contractors who enter areas where there may be a risk 
to product safety, or who undertake work that may constitute a risk to product, are informed 
of the site’s policies and the medical conditions (e.g. the symptoms) that would prevent 
entry into production, storage or open product areas.

Where permitted by legislation, visitors must be screened by use of a health questionnaire. 
The site must ensure that regular visitors and contractors, such as external company staff or 
pest control providers, are included. Where questionnaires are used, these must be reviewed 
by a competent person.

A site with live animals (see clause 5.9.2) may need to include the prevention of transmission 
of animal diseases; for example, by establishing whether the visitor has been to an area 
within the last 48 hours, where there has been a known outbreak or other risk to the animals 
that are on site.

The procedure must be documented.

7.3.3 There shall be procedures for staff (including temporary employees), contractors and visitors 
relating to action to be taken where they may be suffering from or have been in contact with 
an infectious disease. Expert medical advice shall be sought where required.

Interpretation Documented infectious disease procedure

Where staff, visitors or contractors declare they are suffering from, or have been in contact 
with, the identified diseases, infections etc. , they must be subject to, and informed of, the 
procedures to prevent product contamination. This will usually include relocation to a role 
where they are not in contact with open products.

7.4 Protective clothing: staff or visitors to production areas

Suitable site-issued protective clothing shall be worn by staff, contractors or visitors working in or entering 
production areas.

Interpretation

The purpose of protective clothing is to protect the products from contamination. Therefore protective clothing 
includes uniforms, overalls, head coverings (such as hats and hairnets), shoes and boots, aprons and gloves 
(whether disposable or washable). A suitable design of protective clothing must be provided to all staff, visitors and 
contractors working in or visiting production areas.

Clause Requirements
7.4.1 The company shall document and communicate to all staff (including agency and temporary 

personnel), contractors and visitors the rules regarding the wearing of protective clothing 
in specified work areas (e.g. production areas, storage areas). This shall also include policies 
relating to the wearing of protective clothing away from the production environment (e.g. 
removal before entering toilets, and use of canteen and smoking areas).

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Documented protective clothing policy

The company is required to determine and document the procedures for application and 
use of protective clothing based on a risk assessment. The risk assessment must consider 
foreign-body, microbiological and allergen risks as appropriate, as well as general good-
practice principles. It must document:

• what must be worn (e.g. footwear, overalls and hair covering) and the design of each
• where clothing must be put on and taken off, including designated area(s) for changing
• the order in which clothing is applied (e.g. hairnet, footwear, wash hands and then overall 

or coat)
• where protective clothing will be stored when not in use
• special requirements for specific areas
• instructions for the removal of protective clothing when moving away from the production 

area. Good practice is to include details on what should happen to protective clothing 
after removal; for example, the correct disposal of disposable clothing, correct storage of 
reusable clothing or where to put clothing that requires laundering

• removal of protective clothing before entering toilets
• procedures for the removal of protective clothes in canteens and smoking areas
• areas where the product is fully enclosed and has no or very little risk of contamination 

from the factory environment during normal production.

The wearing of full company-issued protective clothing is not an absolute requirement if all 
of the following criteria apply:

• all products are fully enclosed
• the product would, if it were not fully enclosed, be classed as a low-risk product
• the area is separate from areas containing open product
• staff do not need to pass through open product areas to access the area.

The wearing of a company uniform is preferred. Where personal clothing is allowed, sites 
must provide guidance on the standards of clothing which are acceptable.

Wherever product lines are entered (e.g. adjustments at the filler), protective clothing and 
hair coverings must be worn.

7.4.2 Protective clothing shall be available that:

• is provided in sufficient numbers for each employee
• is of suitable design to prevent contamination of the product (at a minimum containing no 

external pockets above the waist or sewn-on buttons)
• fully contains all scalp hair to prevent product contamination
• includes snoods for beards and moustaches, where required, to prevent product 

contamination.

Interpretation Availability and design of protective clothing

Clothing must be available for all staff working in production and storage areas (including 
employment agency staff, temporary staff and contractors). Items must be provided in 
sufficient numbers so that they may be maintained in an acceptable condition during 
working (e.g. to allow for washing).

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

The company needs to consider the design of protective clothing and ensure that it is 
suitable for the production processes. At a minimum:

• the clothing must not include external pockets above the waist (e.g. no pockets in coats) 
and must not have sewn-on buttons

• the company must consider the design of protective footwear for production areas and 
must provide footwear that can be kept clean

• staff and visitors must wear headwear (such as mob caps or hairnets) that completely 
covers head hair to minimise potential contamination

• snoods must be provided for staff or visitors who have beards or moustaches where 
protection is needed to prevent product contamination. Clear rules must be in place and 
understood by staff, based on an assessment by the company.

7.4.3 Protective clothing shall be laundered by an approved contracted or in-house laundry using 
defined criteria to validate the effectiveness of the laundering process. The laundry must 
operate procedures which ensure:

• adequate segregation between dirty and cleaned clothes
• effective cleaning of the protective clothing
• cleaned clothes are supplied protected from contamination until use (e.g. by the use of 

covers or bags).

Washing of protective clothing by the employee is exceptional but shall be acceptable 
where:

• the protective clothing is not used for product safety purposes; for example, it is used to 
protect the employee from the products handled

and
• the protective clothing is worn in enclosed product or low-risk areas only.

Interpretation Laundry

Protective clothing may be cleaned by contracting the services of a specialised laundry, by 
laundering in-house or, in exceptional circumstances, by employees laundering their own 
clothes.

External contracted services must be incorporated within the company’s purchasing supplier 
approval programme (clause 3.5.3.1) and have systems of approval and continual assessment 
to ensure that the process is under control. This should be based on risk assessment and 
may include self-audit questionnaires where low-risk products are manufactured. The 
monitoring of the effectiveness of cleaning is likely to consist of visual assessment and the 
monitoring of complaints.

In-house laundering carried out on the company premises must be controlled. This is likely 
to be via HACCP-style principles, controls and validation data, such as monitoring of the 
temperature and detergent, specifying items not to be washed together, overseeing drying 
processes and visual inspection. The laundry will also be included in the programme of 
internal audits (clause 3.4.1).

Laundries (both in-house and contracted) must ensure that:

• dirty and clean clothing is adequately segregated to ensure that recently laundered items 
are not re-contaminated

• the protective clothing is effectively cleaned (e.g. by the completion of microbiological 
validation and verification tests)

• cleaned clothes are protected from contamination until delivered to the site (e.g. through 
the use of covers or bags).

The Standard allows home laundering of protective clothing by employees, but only in 
exceptional circumstances, where both of the following conditions are met:

• protective clothing is not used for product safety purposes, but is instead used to protect 
the employee from the products handled; for example, in the produce industry, raw 
vegetables arriving from the fields may be covered in mud or dirt, and employees wear 
overalls to protect their personal clothing

and
• it is used only in low-risk or enclosed product areas (these are both defined in Appendix 2 

of the Standard).

It is important that where a site wishes to approve home laundering, both of these 
requirements are satisfied. For example, home laundering would not be permitted in bakeries 
because although the protective clothing is being used in a low-risk area, it is an open 
product area where the clothing is needed to protect the product, not the employee.

Home laundering still requires appropriate care and attention to ensure that potential 
pathogens are removed or killed. Therefore, where approved, home laundering needs to be 
controlled by written instructions, including, for example:

• how garments are to be washed (temperature, detergent, specifying items not to be 
washed together, and drying instructions such as the use of a hot iron to further heat-
disinfect the clothes)

• procedures for transporting clean protective clothing to the workplace; for example, 
provision of sealable plastic bags or similar, which allow washed garments to be 
transported from home to the workplace without becoming contaminated

• on-site procedures; for example, defined responsibility within the company for monitoring 
the effectiveness of the system (typically achieved by visual inspection). There must 
also be a procedure and system for effectively dealing with any case where employees 
are unable to perform self-laundry, either through lack of diligence or through lack of 
facilities. This system must be capable of being brought into immediate effect once a 
problem has been identified.

7.4.4 Protective clothing shall be changed at an appropriate frequency, based on risk.

Interpretation Changing protective clothing

Protective clothing needs to be changed at an appropriate frequency to ensure that clothing 
cannot become a source of product contamination. The frequency of changes must be 
based on risk (e.g. using visual inspections, swabbing or contact plates). For example, hairnets 
are changed daily or whenever they are removed.

7.4.5 If gloves are used, they shall be replaced regularly. Where appropriate, gloves shall be 
suitable for food use, of a disposable type, of a distinctive colour (blue where possible) and 
intact, and shall not shed loose fibres.

Interpretation Gloves

Gloves are a potential source of foreign bodies; therefore, sufficient control procedures 
(such as regular inspection and replacement) need to be put in place to ensure they are 
intact and do not shed loose fibres. The company needs to consider the design of gloves and 
whether they need to be disposable, of food grade and of a visually distinct colour from the 
product (preferably blue).

7.4.6 Where items of protective clothing that are not suitable for laundering are provided (such as 
chain mail, gloves and aprons), these shall be cleaned and disinfected at a frequency based 
on risk.

Interpretation Protective clothing that cannot be laundered

A documented procedure must be developed for protective items that cannot be laundered, 
such as shoes, chain mail (cut-resistant, metallic PPE), gloves and aprons. The frequency of 
cleaning and disinfection must be defined based on risk.

8 Production risk zones – high risk, high care and ambient high care
Where a site produces products where the production process, or part of it, requires high-risk, high-care and/or 
ambient high-care production zones (see clause 4.3.1 for this assessment and Appendix 2 of the Standard for the 
definition of these production zones), all the relevant requirements from sections 1–7 of the Standard must be 
fulfilled in addition to the requirements in this section.

The site shall be able to demonstrate that production facilities and controls are suitable to prevent pathogen 
contamination of products.

Interpretation

Prevention of potential contamination with pathogens is of paramount importance in the production of safe food. 
One of the key ways of achieving this is to ensure the correct design (e.g. segregation) and control (e.g. restricted 
access) of areas of the site where open products, susceptible to contamination, are handled. The Standard defines 
these areas as production risk zones.

The main principle of the production risk zones in the Standard is to ensure that the environmental conditions 
and controls in open product areas are appropriate for the products being handled. Therefore the expectations for 
factory hygiene, finish of buildings, equipment, protective clothing and staff hygiene should reflect the potential 
risks to the product.

Where a site produces products that require handling in high-risk, high-care and/or ambient high-care production 
facilities (see Appendix 2 of the Standard for the definition of products that require these facilities), equivalent 
controls are expected for any subsequent handling or re-packing operation where the product is open to the factory 
environment (i.e. the re-packing site is expected to have equivalent facilities).

BRCGS has produced a specific guideline on high risk, high care and ambient high care, which explains the 
requirements and provides details of good practice. It may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at 
BRCGS Participate.

8.1 Layout, product flow and segregation in high-risk, high-care and ambient high-care 
zones

Interpretation

The requirements in this section are in addition to those in section 4.3. Sites are therefore recommended to review 
the two sections together, rather than separately.

Clause Requirements
8.1.1 The map of the site (see clause 4.3.2) shall include the location of the pathogen control 

step(s).

Interpretation Production risk zones on the site map

Clause 4.3.2 of the Standard requires the site to construct a site map, and this will include 
reference to the production risk zones appropriate to the site.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

It is important to note that the high-care, high-risk and ambient high-care production 
zones usually apply to only part of a factory’s production processes; they typically follow 
a microbiological kill step or pathogen control step, where any pathogens are removed or 
reduced to an acceptable level. For example, this could be a microbiological kill step such 
as heat treatment or cooking, or a process to reduce the pathogen levels such as a chlorine 
wash of fruit or vegetables. The production risk zone needs to be maintained until the 
products are enclosed in packaging.

For high-risk, high-care and ambient high-care areas, the location of the site’s pathogen 
control step(s) must be included on the site map.

As explained in the interpretation for clause 4.3.2, the site map must also include an 
indication of any areas where time segregation is used; for example, which areas apply time 
segregation between high care and low risk. The boundaries of this segregation must be 
clearly detailed.

The Standard is not prescriptive on the format of the site plan; however, good practice is to 
include all the information in an easy-to-use form. Examples include:

• use of schematic diagrams
• overlaying several maps to form a complete picture, which allows both an overview of the 

site and a focus into the specific features detailed on individual layers.

8.1.2 Where high-risk areas are part of the manufacturing site, there shall be physical segregation 
between these areas and other parts of the site. Segregation shall take into account the flow 
of product, the nature of the materials (including packaging), the equipment, the personnel, 
the chemicals, the disposal of waste, the flow of air, the air quality and the provision 
of utilities (including drains). The location of transfer points shall not compromise the 
segregation between high-risk areas and other areas of the factory. Practices shall be in place 
to minimise the risk of product contamination (e.g. the disinfection of materials on entry).

Interpretation High-risk areas

High-risk areas require the highest levels of hygiene, working practices, and design 
and fabrication of facilities and equipment, to prevent product contamination from 
microbiological hazards.

High-risk areas must be fully separated areas, with physical segregation in place between 
them and other parts of the facility. The purpose of the physical segregation is to provide a 
self-contained area where uncovered (i.e. unprotected) high-risk products are handled after 
the microbiological kill step (e.g. heat treatment or cooking) until they are fully protected, 
usually by means of final packaging. The segregating barrier must be capable of minimising 
the risk of cross-contamination from:

• pathogens which may be present in a low-risk environment or on products or ingredients 
that have not received a full cook

• all people moving between the high-risk area and other areas, except through designated 
changing areas

• the movement of all equipment, cleaning chemicals, utensils or materials into the high-risk 
area, except through designated ports with sanitising controls in place

• water or other liquids (e.g. cleaning chemicals) on the floor, washing into the high-risk area
• airborne contaminants (e.g. dust particles or water droplets).

Interpretation

The ideal barrier is a full wall (e.g. a separate room) separating the high-risk area from other 
areas. In assessing the suitability of a segregating barrier, a risk assessment should be carried 
out and documented.

Time segregation is not an acceptable alternative for high-risk areas, except for the transfer 
areas noted below. The location and operation of all transfer points must not compromise 
high-risk and low-risk segregation. For example, where raw materials or staff move into a 
high-risk area, consideration must be given to whether this introduces a contamination 
hazard; it may therefore require measures that involve:

• use of disinfection
• removal of outer packaging
• double-door ovens, blast chillers or freezers (i.e. those with a separate entrance and exit)
• controlled air flow (clause 8.2.2)
• changing the design of entrances and exits (e.g. roller lifting doors may represent a risk 

when raised, due to the fact they have been in contact with the floor and the difficulty in 
cleaning them effectively).

High-risk areas are expected to be self-contained and fully segregated. Best practice is that, 
where there is a cook step in the production of high-risk products, the cooker becomes 
the transfer point into the high-risk area via a double-door system (i.e. the cooker is loaded 
in the low-risk area and unloaded directly into the high-risk area). While new cooker 
installations and new-build sites must incorporate double-door cooking systems, many 
existing plants are equipped with single-door cookers and have established risk-based 
procedures for the loading and unloading of the cookers to prevent cross-contamination 
of cooked products. The Standard will, therefore, accept the use of single-door cooking 
systems where a thorough risk assessment has been completed as an interim measure 
prior to the eventual upgrading. Operating practices must be consistently achievable and 
effective, and prevent cross-contamination of cooked products.

The risk assessment must consider, and control potential risk, from:

• crossover between cooked and raw products in the unloading area
• operators and their clothing (e.g. handling of cooked products by operators who have 

previously worked with raw products)
• hand-contamination resulting from touching surfaces such as common equipment, cooker 

control panels and cooker door handles
• equipment used for transferring product into and out of cookers
• airborne contamination from low-risk processes (e.g. the loading and unloading area 

should be separate from the main low-risk processing area)
• the floor (e.g. contamination of the wheels of trolleys transferring cooked products to the 

high-risk area).

When cooked products are unloaded from the cooker, they must be moved immediately 
to a designated high-risk area to meet the requirements of the Standard. The auditor will 
assess the procedures in operation where single-door cookers are in use to ensure they 
are adequate, effective and understood by operators. The audit report will describe the 
procedures in place to protect the cooked products from contamination.

High-risk areas contain only components and foods which have undergone a cook or similar 
process to achieve, typically, a 6-log reduction for Listeria. Where a single area includes, by 
necessity, some components which have received a lesser kill, together with fully cooked 
components (e.g. in a sandwich preparation area), this will be classed as high care.

Example Cooked crustacea – a product requiring a high-risk production zone

Where crustacea are cooked as part of the production process, or were cooked at an earlier 
step in the production process (including at another site), the site will need to ensure the 
correct production risk zones are used.

According to the definitions in Appendix 2 of the Standard, cooked crustacea fit into the 
definition of a product requiring a high-risk production zone because:

• finished product is chilled or frozen to preserve food safety
• all components have received a full cook (equivalent to a 6 log reduction in Listeria 

monocytogenes)
• finished product is vulnerable to growth of pathogens or survival of pathogens that could 

subsequently grow during normal storage and use
• finished product is ready to eat or ready to heat or, on the basis of known consumer use, is 

likely to be eaten without adequate cooking.

Although the Standard recognises that some food products can be effectively managed 
using consumer cooking instructions, these instructions are not considered a valid 
justification for using a different production zone for cooked crustacea, as known consumer 
use in many countries is to eat the product cold without any heating, and therefore without 
a full cook by the consumer. Furthermore, the product appearance could lead consumers to 
believe the product is already fully cooked, and that no additional cooking is required.

Where a site is partially heating a crustacean (i.e. less than a 6-log reduction in Listeria 
monocytogenes), a high-care area will be appropriate.

8.1.3 Where high-care areas are part of the manufacturing site, there should be physical 
segregation between these areas and other parts of the site. Segregation shall take into 
account the flow of product, the nature of materials (including packaging), the equipment, 
the personnel, the chemicals, the disposal of waste, the flow of air, the air quality and the 
provision of utilities (including drains).

Where physical barriers are not in place, the site shall have undertaken a documented risk 
assessment of the potential for cross-contamination, and effective, validated processes 
shall be in place to protect products from contamination, including the procedures for 
changeover from low-risk to high-care.

Interpretation High-care areas

This clause is applicable to high-care areas (i.e. areas designed to a high standard, where 
practices are in place to minimise product contamination by pathogenic micro-organisms; 
see Appendix 2 of the Standard).

Vulnerable products and ingredients have, before entry to the high-care area, undergone a 
process to reduce any contamination by pathogenic bacteria (e.g. a chlorine wash of salad 
materials, or an early cook step as in the pasteurisation of cream). It is important that the 
high-care area is effectively protected from contamination by low-risk zones. This is most 
effectively achieved through full physical segregation by means of walls which separate the 
high-care area from other factory areas.

Where a separate, fully walled-off area is not available, alternative procedures must be in 
place to segregate the high-care area. The segregating barrier must be capable of preventing 
the risk of cross-contamination from:

• unauthorised access and movement between high-care and other areas of the factory, 
except through designated changing areas

• transfer of materials, cleaning chemicals, utensils or equipment, except through designated 
ports with sanitising controls in place

• microbiological contamination which may be present in a low-risk environment
• airborne contaminants (e.g. dust particles or water droplets).

The segregating barrier may include time or space separation, control of movement or 
other restrictions. In assessing its suitability, a risk assessment must be carried out and 
documented. The method employed must be validated to demonstrate that the controls 
are effective in preventing cross-contamination. The auditor will critically examine the 
arrangements to ensure that potential risks for contamination have been addressed, and 
that the alternative controls are consistently workable before the solution is considered 
acceptable. (This will be recorded in the audit report.)

Where the solution is time segregation (i.e. a time separation between low-risk and high-
care products being produced in the same area, to allow the area to be converted from 
a low-risk zone to a high-care zone (e.g. by cleaning, changes of protective clothing, or 
environmental monitoring)):

• The changeover between low-risk and high-care operations should be as infrequent as 
possible, as it is unlikely that a sufficient standard of cleaning could be reached if changes 
occur frequently during the day.

• Fully validated procedures to change the area from low risk to high care are required. 
These activities need to be taken into account when scheduling production, to ensure 
effective transformation of the area, including personnel. If the same personnel are 
responsible for the area during low-risk and high-care operations, they must undergo a 
complete change of protective clothing.

• The shared area must be designed to meet the requirements of the high-care zone. 
Therefore all the facilities must be appropriate for a high-care production zone; for 
example, drainage is appropriate and meets the requirements of clause 8.2.1.

Where product characteristics meet the description of high care but the systems are fully 
enclosed (e.g. dairies filling cartons with milk), the production area is considered an enclosed 
product area. However, additional precautions are required when breaking into the lines or 
entering filler equipment (e.g. for maintenance, to free product blockage or for cleaning). 
Wherever equipment is entered, the necessary hygiene requirements must be completed 
before operations can recommence.

It is expected that newly built factories will employ full wall segregation where high-care 
facilities are required.

Clause Requirements
8.1.4 Where ambient high-care areas are required, a documented risk assessment shall be 

completed to determine the risk of cross-contamination with pathogens. The risk 
assessment shall take into account the potential sources of microbiological contamination 
and include:

• the raw materials and products
• the flow of raw materials, packaging, products, equipment, personnel and waste
• air flow and quality
• the provision and location of utilities (including drains).

Effective processes shall be in place to protect the final product from microbiological 
contamination. These processes may include segregation, management of process flow or 
other controls.

Interpretation Ambient high-care areas

This clause is applicable to ambient high-care areas (i.e. areas designed to a high standard, 
where practices are in place to minimise product contamination by pathogenic micro-
organisms).

Ambient products that are handled in these areas are vulnerable, as vegetative pathogens 
are known to survive adverse conditions and may subsequently represent a potential food 
poisoning risk.

Products which require handling in ambient high-care areas are those which meet all of the 
following criteria:

• they contain a raw material that is prone to contamination with vegetative pathogens (e.g. 
Salmonella species)

• the production process includes a process step which removes or reduces the pathogen 
(e.g. a microbiological kill step). (Where there is no effective step in the on-site processes, 
it is assumed that any risk associated with the raw material is controlled as part of the raw 
material risk assessment and goods receipt processes.)

• the finished products are stored at ambient temperatures (i.e. above 5°C)
• the finished products are ready to eat or ready to heat or, on the basis of known consumer 

use, are likely to be eaten without adequate cooking
• the finished products are such that vegetative pathogens could survive and grow in normal 

use, subsequently causing food poisoning, or are of a nature (e.g. fatty foods) that enables 
food poisoning to result from a very low level of contamination with a pathogen.

Where products fall into the ambient high care category, the site should conduct a risk 
assessment to identify the potential risks of cross-contamination (e.g. locations where 
cross-contamination could occur) and introduce procedures and processes to manage these 
potential risks.

The procedures required will be dependent on the level of risk, but could, for example, 
include:

• segregation – normally this would be physical separation; however, time segregation 
would be permitted where the site can demonstrate that processes effectively minimise 
the risk of contamination

• cleaning and disinfection processes which ensure that areas where at-risk materials are 
located are maintained at a suitably high level of cleanliness

Standard.

8.2 Building fabric in high-risk and high-care zones

Interpretation

The requirements in this section are in addition to those in section 4.4. Sites are therefore recommended to review 
the two sections together, rather than separately.

Clause Requirements
8.2.1 Where sites include high-risk or high-care facilities, there shall be a map of the drains for 

these areas which shows the direction of flow and the location of any equipment fitted 
to prevent the backup of waste water. The flow from drains shall not present a risk of 
contamination to the high-risk/care area.

Interpretation Drainage for high-risk and high-care areas

The flow of drains must not present a risk of contamination of the high-risk or high-care 
areas. There must be a plan of the drains for these areas which shows the direction of flow 
and location of any equipment fitted to prevent the backing-up of waste water. For example, 
drains should flow from high-risk to low-risk areas and include suitable barriers, such as 
separate drains that are not connected to other areas of the site. They should also feature 
non-return or anti-syphon valves, and one-way traps or a sufficient drop to ensure flow in 
the correct direction.

The map of the drains does not need to be a separate document – it can be incorporated 
into the site map (see clauses 8.1.1 and 4.3.2) if this is more convenient. The direction of flow 
of the drains must be included on the map.

Good practice is for the site to have procedures in place for the action to be taken in the 
event of a failure of the drain traps or if water backs up into the high-risk or high-care areas. 
This should be more than just mopping up and then continuing production, as the clause 
requires that drains must not become a risk of contamination. A full clean, microbiological 
swabbing etc. may be required to reinstate and confirm the status of the high-risk area.

8.2.2 High-risk areas shall be supplied with sufficient changes of filtered air. The filter specification 
used and frequency of air changes shall be documented, based on a risk assessment that 
takes into account the source of the air and the requirement to maintain a positive air 
pressure relative to the surrounding areas.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Ventilation for high-risk areas

High-risk areas must be supplied with sufficient changes of filtered air. Therefore a risk 
assessment must be completed, with the aim of ensuring that the air introduced will not 
contain micro-organisms of concern and will not be a source of additional contamination 
(e.g. through the formation of airborne water droplets). The following criteria should be 
considered:

• the source of air. The air inlet needs to be located to minimise intake of contaminated air 
(at a minimum, it should be upwind of potential contaminants such as dust and chemical 
vapours)

• the frequency of air changes
• the specification of filter used. There is no absolute global standard for the filters used in 

specific food industry applications; the grade required will depend on the source of the air 
and the length of time of exposure of high-risk products/ingredients

• the frequency of replacement of filters
• the need to maintain positive pressure compared with adjacent areas, particularly where 

there is an interface with low-risk areas.

The effectiveness of the system employed should be checked using periodic sampling of air 
microbiological quality.

While there is no specific requirement for an over-pressure of air in high-risk areas, good 
practice is for the ventilation system to be in balance, so that there is no large movement of 
air from low-risk into high-risk areas.

Where air socks are used for high-risk areas, they should be identifiable and kept separate 
from those for other areas.

8.2.3 Where sites include removable walls as part of the design of the high-risk or high-care area 
(e.g. to allow occasional movement of large items or specialist maintenance equipment), 
procedures shall be in place to ensure:

• removable walls are tight fitting
• their use is managed
• movement of the walls is authorised and is completed only by trained and authorised staff
• cleaning and reconditioning procedures are in place and completed prior to production.

Interpretation Removable walls

Production risk zones may have removable walls or removable wall panels, to allow the 
movement of large items or specialist equipment between areas.

Sites must have documented procedures for the use of removable walls. As a minimum, the 
Standard expects:

• these walls are tight fitting (e.g. to ensure pathogen contamination cannot occur through 
any gaps; for example, if air or water movement occurs between the two areas)

• use of the removable wall is managed correctly and in a controlled manner (e.g. its 
removal must be authorised and is only completed by trained and authorised personnel, 
at approved times when there is no production, and in accordance with documented 
procedures)

8.3 Equipment and maintenance in high-risk and high-care zones

Interpretation

The requirements in this section are in addition to those in sections 4.6 and 4.7. Sites are therefore recommended to 
review these sections together, rather than separately.

Clause Requirements
8.3.1 Maintenance activities undertaken in high-risk and high-care areas shall respect the 

segregation requirements of the area. Wherever possible, tools and equipment shall be 
dedicated for use in that area and retained there.

Interpretation Maintenance in high-risk and high-care areas

It is important that maintenance activities do not result in microbiological contamination 
of high-risk or high-care areas. Tools that are frequently needed in the area (e.g. spanners) 
should be dedicated to the area and not removed from there. Where specialist tools or 
equipment need to be brought into an area for a specific task, then mechanisms should be 
in place to ensure that this does not result in contamination (e.g. cleaning equipment before 
entry and post-maintenance cleaning of the high-risk or high-care area).

8.3.2 Where equipment is removed from the high-risk or high-care area, the site shall have a 
procedure to ensure the cleanliness and removal of contamination hazards before the 
equipment is accepted back into the area.

Records of acceptance back into the area shall be maintained.

Interpretation Movement of equipment

Some equipment is moved from place to place in order to be used in different areas. Where 
this occurs, the site must take steps to ensure that re-introduction to those areas does not 
compromise the conditions (i.e. the equipment is suitably clean and will not be a source of 
contamination).

The auditor will expect to see a procedure that addresses the re-introduction of equipment 
to a high-risk or high-care area, as well as evidence of adherence to this procedure where 
equipment has been moved.

8.3.3 Where portable equipment (e.g. handheld devices) and battery-charging equipment is used 
in high-risk or high-care areas, these items shall either:

• be visually distinctive and dedicated for use in that area, or
• have specific procedures (e.g. a full clean) to ensure that their use does not result in 

contamination.

Good practice is for these items to be dedicated to the designated area. Where this is 
not practical, then specific procedures must be in place to prevent contamination (e.g. 
movement only through designated routes with associated cleaning or sanitising controls).

The requirements in this section are in addition to those in section 4.8. Sites are therefore recommended to review 
both of these sections together, rather than separately.

Clause Requirements
8.4.1 Where an operation includes a high-risk or high-care area, personnel shall enter via a 

specially designated changing facility at the entrance to the area. The changing facilities 
shall incorporate the following:

• clear instructions for the order of changing into and out of dedicated protective clothes to 
prevent the contamination of clean clothing

• protective clothing that is visually distinct from that worn in other areas and which shall 
not be worn outside the area

• a hand-washing routine during the changing procedure to prevent contamination of the 
clean clothing (i.e. hand-washing after hair covering and footwear have been put on, but 
before handling clean protective clothing)

• hand-washing and disinfection facilities that shall, as a minimum, be situated:
• prior to entry for high-risk areas
• on entry for high-care areas

• dedicated site footwear that is provided by the site and which shall not be worn outside 
the factory

• an effective control of footwear to prevent the introduction of pathogens into the area. 
Control may be by segregation and a controlled change of footwear before entering the 
area (such as a barrier or bench system), or by the use of controlled and managed boot-
wash facilities where these demonstrably provide an effective control of footwear to 
prevent the introduction of pathogens into the area.

A programme of environmental monitoring shall be used to assess the effectiveness of 
footwear controls.

Interpretation High-risk and high-care area changing facilities

The objective of this clause is to ensure that protective clothing, once applied, is not 
contaminated before entry into the high-risk or high-care area.

In facilities with high-risk or high-care areas, personnel must enter these areas via a specific, 
designated changing facility (i.e. separate from other, lower-risk changing areas) and must 
follow documented instructions to:

• apply specific dedicated protective clothing which is visually distinct (e.g. a different 
colour or style), including clean overalls, headwear and footwear

• apply clothing in a given order; for example:
• put on hair covering
• remove shoes
• step over barrier (see below)
• put on dedicated footwear
• wash hands
• put on coat or overalls
• wash and sanitise hands

• wash hands during the changing procedure.

When personnel leave the high-risk or high-care area, there must be clear instructions 
for changing out of protective clothing to ensure that they remove their overalls before 
handling shoes or a hair covering. (This is particularly important where the clothing is to be 
reused; for example, if someone is temporarily leaving the area for lunch or a break.)

The footwear worn in these areas must be dedicated to the factory (i.e. factory-issued and 
not worn outside the factory) and captive to the area (i.e. worn only in the high-risk area). 
The changing area must be laid out with an effective system to differentiate areas for 
wearing high-risk footwear (e.g. by the use of a barrier or bench system).

By exception, boot-wash facilities may be used instead of changing into captive footwear 
dedicated to the area; these must be located at the entrance to an area. Boot-wash facilities 
must be effectively controlled, managed and validated to prevent the introduction of 
pathogens. The site must have undertaken a risk assessment to identify the suitability of the 
boot-wash facilities, and have established controls to manage the effective sanitation of 
footwear. The controls must have been validated by microbiological swabbing of footwear, 
floors and drains in the high-risk or high-care area to demonstrate the absence of pathogens 
(e.g. Listeria species).

For controls to be effective, they should include the following criteria:

• The footwear must be company-issued and of a design which is easily cleaned (i.e. smooth 
upper surfaces, and cleats on soles sufficiently spaced so as not to trap dirt which may not 
be easily removed by boot-wash equipment).

• The potential for cross-contamination of boots prior to boot-washing must be considered.
• Permitted areas where footwear may be worn prior to entry to an area must be clearly 

defined. For example, the same footwear must not be worn outside the facility or in low-
risk processing areas prior to entering the area.

• The boot-wash equipment must be suitably designed, well maintained and demonstrably 
effective in cleaning and sanitising the footwear.

• The minimum cleaning time and concentrations of detergent and sanitiser must be 
determined, monitored, documented and controlled to ensure effective cleaning of 
footwear.

• A schedule for the cleaning of the boot-wash facility and equipment should be in place 
to ensure that the boot-wash does not become a source or vector of microbiological 
contamination.

• Records of the detergent/sanitiser checks and of the effectiveness of the boot-wash 
facilities are to be kept.

Environmental monitoring programmes must include specific reference to high-risk and 
high-care areas (e.g. footwear, floors and drains) to demonstrate the continued effectiveness 
of the footwear control.

All visitors and contractors entering the area will need dedicated footwear; shoe covers 
are not satisfactory for high-risk or high-care areas, as they rarely cover the whole shoe 
and often tear or fragment during use, resulting in a lack of protection and the potential to 
become foreign-body risks.

The objective of the use of dedicated clothing is to prevent the potential contamination 
of products. If members of the cleaning team (or indeed anyone else, such as engineers 
or visitors) enter an area while production is in progress or open products are present, 
they must follow the same clothing rules as production staff. If cleaning occurs outside 
production time, the absolute rules on protective clothing may be adapted but must ensure 
that the production area is left in a condition, after cleaning, such that no microbiological 
risks have been introduced by the cleaners or the equipment used. The same principles 
apply to engineers undertaking maintenance work (which should be followed by cleaning 
to restore the microbiological security of the area). Wherever practical, auditors will be 
expected to observe the cleaning in high-risk areas to ensure that the practices used are 
effective and that controls are in place to prevent this activity introducing new risks.

and Ambient High Care, available on BRCGS Participate.

8.5 Housekeeping and hygiene in high-risk and high-care zones

Interpretation

The requirements in this section are in addition to those in section 4.11. Sites are therefore recommended to review 
both of these sections together, rather than separately.

Clause Requirements
8.5.1 Environmental cleaning procedures in high-care/high-risk areas shall consider the different 

microbiological risks associated with each production risk zone.

At a minimum, cleaning procedures in high-risk and high-care areas shall include all of the 
requirements in clause 4.11.2. The frequency and methods of cleaning shall be based on risk, 
and the procedures shall be implemented to ensure that appropriate standards of cleaning 
are achieved.

Interpretation Documented cleaning procedures

In addition to clause 4.11.2, the site must consider the different microbiological risks 
associated with each high-risk and high-care area.

Documented cleaning procedures must be in place to ensure consistent and effective 
cleaning. These procedures should be specific to the area being cleaned, i.e. for the high-risk 
or high-care area, as the risks may be different.

Cleaning procedures for these areas need to include information on the:

follow the cleaning chemical manufacturer’s instructions relating to concentration, 
temperature and contact time)

• equipment to be used, such as hoses or brushes
• instructions on the correct and safe dismantling of equipment where this is required for 

cleaning purposes
• records to be kept
• responsibility for verification of cleaning
• methods of verification (e.g. visual inspection, ATP monitoring, microbiological swabs or 

allergen swabs)
• procedures to prevent contamination; for example, if the cleaning team moves from one 

production risk zone to another during the cleaning operations, good practice is to move 
from the higher-risk area to the lower-risk area.

Where equipment requires different levels of cleaning (e.g. between products, or between 
daily and weekly cleans), each requirement should be clearly detailed.

It may be useful to include photographs in the instructions. The procedures need to be 
reviewed and updated when changes occur to the areas to be cleaned.

8.5.2 Microbiological limits for acceptable and unacceptable cleaning performance shall be 
defined for high-risk/high-care production risk zones.

These limits shall be based on the potential hazards relevant to the product or processing 
area. Therefore, acceptable levels of cleaning shall be defined, for example, by visual 
appearance, ATP bioluminescence techniques (see glossary), microbiological testing or 
chemical testing as appropriate. The site shall define the corrective action to be taken when 
monitored results are outside of the acceptable limits.

Where cleaning and disinfection procedures are part of a defined prerequisite plan to 
control the risk of a specific hazard, the procedures and frequencies shall be validated and 
records maintained. This shall include the risk from cleaning chemical residues on food 
contact surfaces.

Interpretation Cleaning performance limits

At a minimum, limits of acceptable and unacceptable cleaning performance must be defined 
for environmental cleaning (i.e. the factory environment) in high-risk and high-care areas. 
The limits need to be based on the risk, and this should be used for assessing whether the 
cleaning undertaken is of an acceptable standard. Acceptable limits may be based on visual 
inspection, ATP monitoring or specific analysis such as microbiological testing.

Where the cleaning procedure forms part of a defined prerequisite (clause 2.2.1), designed 
to manage a specific hazard, the procedure must be validated to confirm that the specified 
cleaning method, chemicals and concentrations are capable of consistently achieving the 
level of performance required. Records of validation must be maintained.

Clause Requirements
8.5.3 Equipment used for cleaning in high-care and high-risk areas shall be:

• visually distinctive and dedicated for use in that area
• hygienically designed and fit for purpose
• cleaned and stored in a hygienic manner to prevent contamination (for example, storing 

equipment in designated locations, off the floor, when not in use).

Interpretation Cleaning equipment

Equipment used for cleaning high-risk or high-care areas must be dedicated for use in 
that area, and therefore retained in the area (i.e. it should not be removed from the area for 
cleaning or any other purpose). It should also be visually distinct (e.g. colour-coded) from 
cleaning equipment used in other areas.

Where it is not possible to effectively clean equipment in the high-risk or high-care area, a 
suitable transfer control should be in operation (e.g. heating or disinfection prior to transfer 
back into the high-risk or high-care area).

The cleaning equipment used in high-risk and high-care areas should also be:

• hygienically designed and fit for purpose; for example, high-pressure hoses are not 
normally used in high-risk areas because of the potential to create aerosols and move 
debris

• cleaned and stored to prevent contamination; for example, many items of equipment 
should be stored off of the floors (the obvious exception being equipment designed for 
cleaning the floors), and in designated storage areas.

8.5.4 Where the site uses CIP equipment, either this shall be for a specific area only (i.e. separate 
equipment for high-risk, high-care and other production areas) or the CIP system shall be 
designed and controlled so that it does not present a risk of contamination to the high-risk/
high-care area (i.e. controlling direction of flow from high-risk/high-care to low-risk areas, 
preventing the recycling or re-use of rinse solutions from one area to another).

Interpretation CIP equipment

It is important that cleaning equipment cannot be a source of product contamination. 
This includes the use of CIP systems. Therefore, in addition to the requirements for CIP 
identified in section 4.11.7, the site must ensure that specific risks to the high-risk and high-
care areas are managed appropriately. As a minimum, the CIP system for high-risk or high-
care areas must be either:

• a dedicated system, with separate CIP from the systems used in other parts of the facility, 
or

• controlled so that contamination cannot occur, including controlled direction of flow from 
higher-risk to lower-risk areas, and not reusing or recycling cleaning chemicals, cleaning 
solutions or rinse solutions from one area to another.

Interpretation Waste disposal in high-risk or high-care areas

It is important that waste disposal systems are not a source of contamination in high-risk or 
high-care areas. Therefore risk assessment must consider the movement and flow of waste 
and waste containers. For example, bins must be dedicated to either high-risk or low-risk 
areas and must not move between the two. Waste from high-risk and high-care areas should 
be transferred to other containers at the transfer point.

The risk assessment for waste in high-risk and high-care areas may be included in the 
previous documented risk assessment on waste disposal (see clause 4.12.3) or as a separate 
document.

8.7 Protective clothing in high-risk and high-care zones

Interpretation

The requirements in this section are in addition to those in section 7.4. Sites are therefore recommended to review 
both of these sections together, rather than separately.

Clause Requirements
8.7.1 Laundering of protective clothing for high-risk and high-care areas shall be done by an 

approved contracted or in-house laundry using defined criteria to validate the effectiveness 
of the laundering process. The laundry must operate procedures which ensure:

• adequate segregation between dirty and cleaned clothes
• adequate segregation between clothes for high-risk, high-care and low-risk areas etc.
• effective cleaning of the protective clothing
• commercial sterilisation of the protective clothing following the washing and drying 

process
• protection of the cleaned clothes from contamination until use.

Interpretation Laundry

Protective clothing may be cleaned by contracting the services of a specialised laundry, or 
by laundering in-house.

External contracted services must be incorporated within the company’s purchasing supplier 
approval programme (clause 3.5.3.1) and have systems of approval and continual assessment 
to ensure that the process is under control.

Interpretation

In-house laundering carried out on the company premises must be controlled. This is likely 
to be done via HACCP-style principles, controls and validation data, such as monitoring 
of the temperature and detergent, specifying items not to be washed together, overseeing 
drying processes, and visual inspection. The laundry will also be included in the programme 
of internal audits (clause 3.4.1).

The aim of the clause is to ensure management of the laundry process for high-risk and 
high-care protective clothing, including segregation of clean and dirty protective clothing 
and of clean clothing used in different risk production zones. Therefore laundries (both in-
house and contracted) must ensure that:

• dirty and clean clothing is adequately segregated to ensure that recently laundered items 
are not re-contaminated

• high-risk, high-care and low-risk clothing is adequately segregated throughout the laundry 
process

• the protective clothing is effectively cleaned (e.g. by the completion of microbiological 
validation and verification tests)

• clothing is commercially sterile following the washing and drying process. This means that 
any vegetative forms of micro-organisms associated with food poisoning and/or spoilage 
must have been removed. To achieve this, a garment should be laundered at a temperature 
no lower than 65°C for a minimum of 10 minutes, or laundered at a temperature no lower 
than 71°C for a minimum of 3 minutes, or in accordance with local regulatory requirements

• cleaned clothes are protected from contamination until delivered to the appropriate area 
of the site (e.g. specific storage for clean protective clothing in the high-risk changing 
facility).

Home laundering is not considered suitable for protective clothing used in high-risk or high-
care areas.

8.7.2 Where protective clothing for high-care or high-risk areas is cleaned by a contracted or in-
house laundry, the laundry shall be audited either directly or by a third party. The frequency 
of these audits shall be based on risk.

Interpretation Protective clothing for high-risk and high-care areas

The company will need to assess and monitor the laundry (e.g. through visual inspection, 
regular audits and a complaints procedure) to ensure that the processes in place for the 
cleaning of high-risk and high-care clothing are maintained and kept consistently under 
control.

The audits of the laundry can be completed either directly (i.e. by the site) or by a suitable 
third party. The frequency of the audits should be based on risk.

8.7.3 Protective clothing for use in high-risk and high-care areas shall be changed at an 
appropriate frequency based on risk, and at a minimum daily.

Protective clothing worn in high-risk or high-care areas must be changed at least daily and 
hairnets changed daily or whenever removed (e.g. when leaving the area).

Where risk assessment determines that more frequent changing is appropriate, the site 
must ensure this occurs. The auditor will expect to see the risk assessment, documented 
protective clothing procedures, and application of the procedures in practice.

Spare protective clothing should be available on demand should currently used items

9 Requirements for traded products
Traded products are defined as food products that would normally fall within the scope of the Standard and are 
stored at the facilities of the site being audited, but that are not manufactured, processed, reworked, packed or 
labelled at that site.

The site’s management of these products is covered by the requirements in this section.

All the relevant requirements from sections 1 to 8 must also be fulfilled in addition to the requirements outlined in 
this section.

Where a site wishes to be audited against section 9 of the Standard, all of the food products and food raw materials 
traded must be included in the audit scope. It is not permitted to include some traded food products or food raw 
materials and exclude others.

Non-conformities against clauses within section 9 of the Standard will be recorded on the audit report and included 
in the calculation of the site’s grade.

Where a site has traded food products or food raw materials on site but wishes them to be excluded from the scope 
of the audit, this will be recorded as an exclusion from scope on the audit report.

Interpretation

Traded products include food final products, food raw materials and food ingredients that are:

• purchased and sold (but not manufactured, processed, reworked, packed or labelled on site)
• stored for another site, e.g. another site in the same company (but are not manufactured, processed, reworked, 

packed or labelled on site).

Traded products do not include:

• non-food products, non-food ingredients or non-food raw materials 
• any material that is manufactured, processed, reworked, packed or labelled on site (for example, where a product is 

subject to an outsourced process, but subsequently returns to the site for further processing, packing or labelling, 
it is not considered a traded product).

The auditor will require some additional time to complete the audit of traded products. Full information on audit 
duration, including the additional time required for auditing traded products, can be found in the audit duration 
calculator.

9.1 The food safety plan – HACCP

The site shall operate a HACCP or food safety plan for the processes for which it is responsible.

Interpretation

It is important that traded products are managed correctly to ensure that:

• product safety, legality and traceability are maintained
• the traded products do not represent a food safety risk to the products manufactured, processed, reworked, 

packed or labelled on site.

The first step in the management of the traded products is therefore to complete a HACCP or food safety plan 
which specifically includes these products.

Clause Requirements
9.1.1 The company shall either:

• have a HACCP or food safety plan specifically for the traded products handled on site, or
• incorporate the traded products into its existing HACCP or food safety plans (see 

section 2).

The scope of traded products HACCP or food safety plan shall include the products and the 
processes for which the site is responsible. At a minimum, this shall include goods receipt, 
storage and dispatch.

Interpretation The purpose of this requirement is to create a food safety plan to mitigate any food safety 
hazards associated with the traded products. The site may either:

• complete a separate HACCP or food safety plan solely relating to the traded products. 
A separate plan is most useful in situations where the traded products are considerably 
different from the products manufactured, processed or packed on site, or have 
considerably different hazards associated with them; or

• include the traded products within the existing HACCP or food safety plan completed in 
accordance with section 2 of the Standard. A combined food safety plan may be useful 
where the traded products are similar to those manufactured, processed or packed on site, 
and therefore have similar hazards.

The scope must include all the products and processes for which the site is responsible. As a 
minimum, this will include:

• receipt of goods
• storage
• dispatch.

9.2 Approval and performance monitoring of manufacturers/packers of traded food 
products

The company shall operate procedures for approval of the last manufacturer or packer of food products which 
are traded to ensure that traded food products are safe, legal and manufactured in accordance with any defined 
product specifications.

Interpretation

All traded food products brought onto the site must be sourced from approved suppliers who are regularly 
monitored for their performance. The risk assessment process should focus more on those products and suppliers 
that present a greater risk (in terms of safety, authenticity, legality and quality).

Clause Requirements
9.2.1 The company shall have a documented supplier approval procedure which identifies the 

process for initial and ongoing approval of suppliers and the manufacturer/processor of each 
product traded. The requirements shall be based on the results of a risk assessment which 
shall include consideration of:

• the nature of the product and associated risks
• customer-specific requirements
• legislative requirements in the country of sale or importation of the product
• source or country of origin
• potential for adulteration or fraud
• potential risks in the supply chain to the point of receipt of the goods by the company
• the brand identity of products (i.e. customer own-brand or branded product).

Interpretation Supplier approval and monitoring system: risk assessment

For easier management, sites could choose to integrate the approval process for their traded 
products suppliers with that for their raw materials suppliers, or organise the traded products 
suppliers as a separate work stream.

All suppliers of traded products must be evaluated on the basis of a documented risk 
assessment for their ability to meet the specifications of the products they are supplying 
to the certificated site; in particular the requirements for safety, quality and legality. For 
example, the assessment should consider:

• known hazards associated with the product provided (e.g. microbiological, chemical or 
foreign-body risks). Access to reference information and an awareness of emerging food 
issues are essential to ensure all known risks are assessed (see clause 1.1.8)

• customer or legislative requirements (e.g. suppliers may be specified by customers, but this 
does not negate the need for risk assessment). Legislation in the country of expected sale 
should be considered

• geographic origins (products from particular countries may carry a greater risk because of 
environmental conditions, more relaxed local legal requirements or a less developed food 
safety culture)

• the potential for fraudulent activity or food defence issues in the supply chain (e.g. 
undeclared additions, dilution or substitution of the raw material or a component of it).

Additional focus must be placed on products where claims are being made (e.g. organic, or 
suitable for individuals with food allergies). Suppliers and their control systems must be 
assessed robustly to ensure compliance with the requirements.

The outcome of this activity must also be considered when assessing the requirements for 
supplier approval and monitoring procedures (clauses 9.2.2 and 9.2.4).

9.2.2 The company shall have a procedure for the initial and ongoing approval of manufacturers 

of products. This approval procedure shall be based on risk and include either one or a 
combination of:

• a valid certification to the applicable BRCGS Standard or GFSI-benchmarked standard. The 
scope of the certification shall include the products purchased

• supplier audits, with a scope to include product safety, traceability, HACCP review 
and good manufacturing practices, undertaken by an experienced and demonstrably 
competent product safety auditor. Where this supplier audit is completed by a second or 
third party, the company shall be able to:
• demonstrate the competency of the auditor
• confirm that the scope of the audit includes product safety, traceability, HACCP review 

and good manufacturing practices
• obtain and review a copy of the full audit report

or
• where a valid risk-based justification is provided and the supplier is assessed as low 

risk only, a completed supplier questionnaire may be used for initial approval. The 
questionnaire shall have a scope that includes product safety, traceability, HACCP review 
and good manufacturing practices, and it shall have been reviewed and verified by a 
demonstrably competent person.

Interpretation Supplier approval and monitoring system: approval procedure

The company must document its procedure for supplier approval and monitoring. This needs 
to include the methods of approval, frequency of monitoring, staff responsibilities and how 
the process will be managed.

Approval will be dependent on the product and the risks associated with it (the output of 
clauses 9.2.1 and 9.1.1) and will include one or more of the following activities:

• certification to the relevant BRCGS Standard (such as food safety, packaging, storage and 
distribution, or agents and brokers) or a GFSI-benchmarked scheme. The site must confirm 
the validity of the certification. This will include:

• confirmation of the certification status (this could be confirmed on an independent 
database; for BRCGS Standards, it can be confirmed in the BRCGS Directory). 
Photocopies of certificates are not recommended and on their own are not considered 
suitable validation of certification status. During the BRCGS audit, the site may be asked 
to demonstrate its validation process

• confirmation that the certification remains up to date (e.g. by receiving confirmation of 
successful completion of the recertification process or by recording certificate expiry 
dates and completing checks for ongoing certification)

• confirmation that the products are within the scope of the certification.

• a successful site audit which at a minimum covers product safety, traceability, HACCP 
and good manufacturing processes. This audit must be completed by an appropriately 
experienced and competent auditor (i.e. someone who has completed training in auditing 
techniques, has experience of auditing, and has knowledge of the product, ingredient or 
processes being audited). Non-conformities should be addressed (e.g. in an agreed action 
with timescales) unless they are critical to product safety or legality, in which case supply 
should not be permitted until non-conformities have been satisfactorily addressed. If the 
supplier is audited to a standard that is not GFSI-benchmarked, this may be acceptable 
providing that:
• the scope of the audit meets the requirements of the Standard
• the site has a copy of the full audit report (not just a certificate)
• the site can demonstrate the competence of the auditor.

Where the risk assessment (completed as part of this clause) indicates that a supplier is low 
risk (because of the history of trading with the site, the nature of the products traded etc.), 
the completion of a supplier questionnaire with a focus on food safety and quality may 
be sufficient. If a supplier questionnaire is the only mechanism used to assess a supplier 
(i.e. there are no additional activities such as supplier audits), then it is important that the 
questionnaire (and the replies from the supplier) contains all the relevant information to 
allow the site to confidently decide on approval.

The auditor will expect to see, and will challenge, any risk assessments that determine that 
suppliers have been deemed to be low risk.

9.2.3 Records shall be maintained of the manufacturer’s/packer’s approval process, including audit 
reports or verified certificates confirming the product safety status of the manufacturing/
packing sites supplying the products traded. There shall be a process of review and records 
of follow-up of any issues identified at the manufacturing/packing sites with the potential to 
affect food products traded by the company.

Interpretation Records of approval

The site is required to maintain records of the approval methods along with the evidence 
used to approve that supplier.

Approval and associated risk assessments must be up to date and the site should therefore 
review the supplier assessment whenever there is an issue at the site manufacturing the 
traded food product.

9.2.4 There shall be a process for the ongoing review of manufacturers/packers, based on risk and 
using defined performance criteria, which may include complaints, results of any product 
tests, regulatory warnings/alerts, customer rejections or feedback. The process shall be fully 
implemented.

Where approval is based on questionnaires, these shall be reissued at least every 3 years 
and suppliers shall be required to notify the site of any significant changes in the interim, 
including any change in certification status.

Records of the review shall be kept.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Ongoing monitoring

As much as it is important to know how and why suppliers are approved, it is also vital 
to ensure that ongoing approval is justified. The site is free to determine how it confers 
continuing approval on its suppliers, but it must ensure that the supplier’s performance is 
matching its own food safety objectives.

The defined performance criteria can be determined by the site. These may include:

• punctuality of deliveries against planned delivery times
• incidences of contamination
• quality of material supplied.

Frequency of ongoing approval is also left for the site to determine; however, it must reissue 
the questionnaires (where used) at least once every 3 years. The site should be able to 
demonstrate to the auditor that the monitoring it uses is appropriate, justified and risk-based. 
Examples of different types of monitoring will be required.

All records of the review must be maintained.

9.3 Specifications

Specifications or information to meet legal requirements and assist customers in the safe usage of the product 
shall be maintained and available to customers.

Interpretation

A finished product specification must exist for all traded food products to ensure that legislation requirements and 
customer expectations are met.

Consideration must be given to the legislative requirements in the country where the product will be sold or used.

Clause Requirements
9.3.1 Specifications shall be available for all products. These shall either be in the agreed format 

as supplied by the customer or, where this is not specified, include key data to meet legal 
requirements and assist the customer in the safe usage of the product.

Specifications may be in the form of a printed or electronic document, or part of an online 
specification system.

Interpretation Product specifications

Specifications for all products must be provided and adequately detailed. They must include 
the defined data for all parameters critical to the safety, legality and quality of the product. 
The specifications may be in the format provided by the supplier or in the company’s own 
format, as long as the information controlling the product’s safety, quality and legality are 
clearly defined.

9.3.2 The company shall seek formal agreement of the specifications with relevant parties. Where 
specifications are not formally agreed, the company shall be able to demonstrate that it has 
taken steps to ensure formal agreement is in place.



FOOD SAFETY

INTERPRETATION GUIDELINE

290   brcgs.com

Clause Requirements

Interpretation Formal agreement of specifications

The site must have a formal specification approval process for its customers and suppliers.

For example, customer-branded finished product specifications must be formally agreed 
and, wherever possible, signed by both parties. However, where signature or approval is 
not formally available, proof that specifications have been issued (such as an email request 
for formal acknowledgement, or specifications uploaded onto a customer IT specification 
system) is required. In this situation the site must be able to demonstrate it is following a 
formal process agreed with its customer.

9.3.3 Companies shall operate demonstrable processes to ensure that any customer-specified 
requirements are met. This may be by inclusion of customer requirements within buying 
specifications, or by undertaking further work on the purchased product to meet the 
customer’s specification (e.g. sorting or grading of product).

Interpretation Customer requirements

Many customers have specific requirements relating to product safety, authenticity, 
quality and legality and the site needs to ensure that it is aware of these requirements and 
understands them (e.g. by retaining copies of relevant customer’s policy documents or 
service-level agreements).

The site must also have a mechanism for ensuring these requirements are met. For example, 
by communicating with the relevant suppliers of products, by incorporating the information 
in specifications, or by recording minutes of review meetings in which the requirements are 
agreed with the supplier.

Occasionally the site may arrange for additional work to be completed on the product 
before it is sent to the customer. Good practice is to ensure that any changes to the 
requirements are communicated and agreed in a timely manner.

9.3.4 Specification review shall be sufficiently frequent to ensure that data is current or at a 
minimum every 3 years, taking into account product changes, suppliers, regulations and other 
risks.

Reviews and changes shall be documented.

Interpretation Review of specifications

Specifications must be reviewed whenever changes occur to the product, process or 
formulation.

Where no known changes have occurred, the specifications should be reviewed at least 
every 3 years, or more frequently if required, to ensure they remain completely up to date 
and accurate. Evidence that a review has been completed needs to be available. This could, 
for example, be achieved by the addition of a signature and date to the specification, or by 
using a matrix showing specifications and the latest review date and reviewer.

The control of the amendment and approval of specifications should be documented in a 
procedure. The procedure should also detail who can approve the amendments.

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

Some sites, companies or customers use cloud-based services which are able to notify 
the user when there has been a change to the data. In this case the site should have a 
mechanism to review the specification/change to understand whether there is any impact on 
the product.

9.4 Product inspection and laboratory testing

The site shall operate processes to ensure that the products received comply with buying specifications and that 
the supplied product is in accordance with any customer specification.

Interpretation

The company needs to identify and schedule critical inspections and analyses for its traded food products. These 
may include:

• identification of known product safety risks associated with the product type
• assessment of legal requirements, particularly those associated with the country of intended sale (where known)
• assurance of product authenticity (e.g. where a genuine risk of adulteration, substitution or fraud has been 

identified during a vulnerability assessment; see clause 5.4.3)
• inspection of quality attributes (e.g. where these form part of a specification agreed with the customer).

The frequency and types of inspections and analyses are not prescribed by the Standard, but should be risk-based, 
specific to the type of products.

Clause Requirements
9.4.1 The site shall have a product sampling or assurance programme to verify that the products 

are in accordance with buying specifications and meet legal and safety requirements.

Where verification is based on sampling, the sample rate and assessment process shall be 
risk-based.

Records of the results of assessments or analysis shall be maintained.

Interpretation Product test schedules

The company needs to have a documented schedule of product sampling or assurance tests 
which are carried out on the products.

The objective of product tests is to ensure that products are manufactured to specification 
and in compliance with safety and legislative requirements. The frequency and type of 
product tests should be based on risk and on any particular customer requirements. They 
may, for example, include:

• quality tests (e.g. appearance, colour or organoleptic qualities)
• safety tests (e.g. chemical or microbiological) or tests to confirm legality (e.g. country of 

origin or species)
• customer-specific requirements based on the specification or the customer’s contract with 

the company.



FOOD SAFETY

Clause Requirements

Interpretation 
continued

The site should be able to explain and justify the basis for the frequency of tests with 
reference to historical or scientific information as appropriate.

Good practice is for the test method and specifications to be documented. Where the 
results of a test are not quantitative, colour standards or reference samples must be used to 
provide a reference point for the test results (i.e. to define pass/fail criteria).

Where tests are completed on site, the location of the testing should be considered. For 
example, laboratory facilities will need appropriate siting and controls, and organoleptic 
tests should be completed in a designated area rather than on the production line (see 
clause 5.6.5).

9.4.2 Where verification of conformity is provided by the supplier (e.g. certificates of conformity 
or analysis), the level of confidence in the information provided shall be supported by 
commissioning periodic independent product analysis.

Interpretation Verification of conformity

The company must be able to demonstrate that each product meets legal requirements for 
its use.

Products are often traded with supporting evidence provided by the supplier (e.g. in the 
form of a certificate of analysis or certificate of conformity relating to the specific batch or 
lot of product supplied). Where these are used, they must be supported by procedures to 
substantiate the reliability of the information using independent product analysis.

The frequency of this periodic assessment should be based on risk assessment that 
considers the likelihood of an error occurring and the potential consequences if an error 
occurred.

9.4.3 Where claims are made about the products being handled, including the provenance, chain 
of custody and assured or ‘identity preserved’ status of a product or raw materials used, 
supporting information shall be available from the supplier or independently to verify the 
claim.

Interpretation Status verification of products

The types of claim covered by this clause relate to the provenance of products that 
differentiates it from the norm. Such a claim may be made either on the product label for 
the consumer or in business-to-business communication. The types of claim include:

• varietal claims (e.g. basmati rice, Aberdeen Angus beef, Bramley apples and cod fish cakes)
• origin claims (e.g. Madagascan vanilla and Florida grapefruit)
• assurance claims (e.g. GLOBALG.A.P. , Red Tractor, Marine Stewardship, dolphin-friendly 

tuna and sustainable palm oil)
• identity-preserved claims (e.g. GMO (genetically modified organism) free).

It is the responsibility of the site to obtain sufficient supporting information to ensure that 
the product claims are genuine and proven.

Interpretation 
continued

For many assurance schemes, such as GLOBALG.A.P. , it is possible to check the assurance 
status and the scope of products of the supplier on a database. Reliance solely on a 
declaration from a supplier will not be sufficient. Where claims relate to variety or species 
(e.g. varieties of fruit), examination of visual characteristics may suffice. However, for claims 
where visual analysis is not possible (e.g. block frozen fish), certificates of analysis and 
periodic sample analysis will be required.

9.4.4 Where the company undertakes or subcontracts analyses which are critical to product 
safety or legality, the laboratory or subcontractors shall have gained recognised laboratory 
accreditation or operate in accordance with the requirements and principles of ISO/IEC 
17025. Documented justification shall be available where non-accredited test methods are 
used.

Interpretation Analyses critical to safety and legality

This clause applies to tests which are critical to product safety or legality. Results from such 
tests must be credible and may be called upon in a court of law.

The company needs to identify which tests are critical to product safety or legality, such as 
compliance with label claims/declarations (e.g. nutritional claims, alcohol content) and tests 
for contamination (e.g. by pesticides, aflatoxins).

Note that while the laboratory itself may have accreditation, the actual test methods must 
also be accredited. Any method of analysis that is not accredited needs justification as to 
why it was used (e.g. it may be a method for which no accreditation is yet available). Where 
critical tests are carried out by non-accredited laboratories (either contracted or on-site 
laboratories), there must be suitable documentary assurances that the laboratory is working 
to the requirements and principles of ISO/IEC 17025. This must include confirmation of the 
laboratory’s procedures to meet the following general principles:

• staff competency and documented training
• documented test methodology based on accepted standards
• equipment that is fit for purpose and appropriately calibrated
• a documented quality assurance programme, including paired testing, ring testing etc.
• completion of internal audits of the laboratory’s operation.

9.4.5 Test and inspection results shall be retained and reviewed to identify trends. Appropriate 
actions shall be implemented promptly to address any unsatisfactory results or trends.

Interpretation Reviewing test results

Systems of recording and review must be formalised and must include evidence of actions 
taken on identified trends, or where unsatisfactory results have been recorded. The use of 
graphs or charts of test results provides a good method of identifying trends and anomalous 
results.

It is important that the employees completing the review understand the results and their 
significance such that appropriate actions can be taken; for example, if a result is outside 
specification, or exceeds a legal or safety limit.

9.5 Product legality

The company shall have processes in place to ensure that the food products traded comply with the legal 
requirements in the country of sale where known.

Interpretation

The company needs to maintain awareness of, and ensure compliance with, relevant legal requirements for its 
products in the countries where the products are sold. These may be associated with composition, labelling or how 
the products are sold.

Clause Requirements
9.5.1 The company shall have documented processes to verify the legality of products which are 

traded. These processes shall include as appropriate:

• labelling information
• compliance with relevant legal compositional requirements
• compliance with quantity or volume requirements.

Where such responsibilities are undertaken by the customer, this shall be clearly stated in 
contracts.

Interpretation Legal compliance

Products traded must meet all the legal requirements for the intended country of use. The 
site must therefore have processes to ensure it remains up to date with requirements such 
as labelling in that country and that these requirements are met and fulfilled.

At a minimum the Standard requires labelling, composition, and quantity or volume 
requirements as applicable, depending on the product to be considered.

Where labelling is not controlled by the company but is the responsibility of the customer, 
this shall be clearly stated in contracts. Good practice is to ensure that all the relevant 
information is transferred to the customer and that any changes are communicated in a 
timely manner.

9.6 Traceability

The company shall be able to trace all product lots back to the last manufacturer and forward to the customer of 
the company.

Interpretation

In keeping with the traceability requirements for manufactured and processed products, sites that trade food 
products are required to maintain traceability, allowing food businesses and authorities to withdraw or recall 
products that have been identified as unsafe. The system must ensure that products supplied to customers are 
adequately labelled or identified to facilitate traceability. Traceability details need to be retained in a format that 
allows access in a timely manner.

Clause Requirements
9.6.1 The site’s traceability procedure (see clause 3.9.1) shall include details of the system used 

for the traceability of traded products.

The traceability system shall ensure that, for all batches of product, the site can identify the 
last manufacturer or, in the case of primary agricultural products, the packer or place of last 
significant change to the product.

Records shall also be maintained to identify the recipient of each batch of product from the 
company.

Interpretation Identification of product

The site’s traceability procedure must include details of the system used for the traceability 
of traded products, to ensure legal requirements are maintained and that the site can 
identify implicated batches of traded product in the event of a product recall or withdrawal.

Products may be identified by physical labelling or through the use of computerised bar-
coding systems. The level of traceability must be able to identify the supplier of the product 
and to whom it is supplied (i.e. one step forwards and one step back). This will enable the 
product to be identified if a particular batch needs to be recalled.

Consider how the traceability system operates in practice (with the effective physical 
identification of products). For example, if batches or lots of product are broken down into 
smaller consignments for individual customers, is all of the necessary information available 
to the customer (i.e. was there any additional information on the original outer packaging 
that the customer would need to ensure traceability?), and can the site confidently identify 
all of these individual customers?

Strict controls on identification, traceability and segregation are also required to preserve 
the integrity of any claims made, such as organic status. Where logos are used that 
make specific claims about production systems (e.g. farm assurance), full traceability and 
validations must be demonstrated (see also section 5.4).

9.6.2 The company shall test the traceability system at least annually to ensure that traceability 
can be determined back to the last manufacturer and forward to the recipient of the product 
from the company. This shall include identification of the movement of the product through 
the chain from the manufacturer to receipt by the company (e.g. each movement and 
intermediate place of storage).

Interpretation Tests of the traceability system

The site’s traceability system for traded products must be tested at least annually. 
Traceability testing may be completed as part of a real product recall or withdrawal 
scenario if one has occurred, since the objective is to test the system and identify areas for 
improvement, rather than supply records of a ‘test’ for its own sake.

The system must provide traceability ‘forwards’ and ‘backwards’; therefore it should be 
tested in both directions. For example, a product could be selected and traced forwards to 
show to whom it was dispatched.

Clause Requirements
9.6.3 The traceability test shall include the reconciliation of quantities of product received by 

the company for the chosen batch or product lot. Traceability should be achievable within 4 
hours (1 day when information is required from external parties).

Interpretation Traceability results

The test of traceability should be timed, and full traceability would be expected to be 
achieved within 4 hours, unless information is required from external parties, such as 
suppliers. This is to reflect the need for rapid traceability in the event of a recall. Where 
traceability takes longer than 4 hours, the site should review the areas where the retrieval of 
information is slow, in order to identify improvements.

The tests must also include a reconciliation of quantities (sometimes referred to as a 
quantity check or mass balance exercise). The objective is to be able to account for the 
usage of a full batch of product. This helps to ensure that the traceability systems are 
capable of operating effectively should a product recall be required.

The reconciliation exercise is usually undertaken as follows:

• Select a batch code of a particular specific product.
• Identify the quantity of product received under that batch code.
• Identify the customers purchasing that product and the amounts each received of the 

specific batch.
• Calculate the quantity of any unused part of the batch in the warehouse.
• Reconcile the quantity received against the amounts sold plus any residual unused stock.

Food safety plan Often referred to as a HACCP plan. The food safety plan is a set of documents prepared 
in accordance with the Codex Alimentarius HACCP principles to ensure the control of 
food-borne hazards.

The specific terminology used in the Standard, such as ‘prerequisites’ and ‘critical 
control points’ (CCPs), is intended to reflect the global terminology used to describe 
expectations. Sites are not required to use the specific terminology in the Standard; 
alternatives are acceptable providing it is evident that all the requirements have been 
fully met.

Food security Procedures adopted to ensure the continued availability of raw materials and products.

Fundamental 
requirement

A requirement of the Standard that relates to a system which must be well established, 
continuously maintained and monitored by the company as absence or poor adherence 
to the system will have serious repercussions on the integrity or safety of the product 
supplied.

Genetically modified 
organism (GMO)

An organism whose genetic material has been altered by the techniques of genetic 
modification so that its DNA contains genes not normally found there.

Global Food Safety 
Initiative (GFSI)

physical or radiological).

Hazard Analysis and 
Critical Control Point 
(HACCP)

A system that identifies, evaluates and controls hazards which are significant for food 
safety.

High-care area A zone (or area) designed to a high standard where practices relating to personnel, 
ingredients, equipment, packaging and environment aim to minimise product 
contamination by pathogenic micro-organisms.

High-care product A product that requires chilling or freezing during storage, is vulnerable to the growth of 
pathogens, has received a process to reduce the microbiological contamination to safe 
levels (typically 1–2 log reduction) and is ready to eat or heat.

High-risk area A physically segregated zone (or area), designed to a high standard of hygiene, where 
practices relating to personnel, ingredients, equipment, packaging and environment aim 
to prevent product contamination by pathogenic micro-organisms.

High-risk product A chilled or frozen ready-to-eat/ready-to-heat product or food where there is a high risk 
of growth of pathogenic micro-organisms.

Identity preserved A product which has a defined origin or purity characteristic which needs to be retained 
throughout the food chain (e.g. through traceability and protection from contamination).

Measurement 
uncertainty (sometimes 
referred to as uncertainty 
of measurement)

A parameter that is associated with the result of a quantitative measurement. It 
characterises the range of values that could reasonably be expected for the attribute 
being measured (e.g. the micro-organism, allergen or chemical). It is sometimes referred 
to as the margin of doubt for the result.

Measurement uncertainty is important when making conformity decisions (i.e. assessing 
whether a test result is within legal, safe or acceptable limits) as the uncertainty or range 
of probable values may cross the limit.

A full explanation of measurement uncertainty is given in the Global Standard Food 
Safety Interpretation Guideline for clause 5.6.2.

Mitigation strategies Controls to remove, or reduce to an acceptable level, an identified risk, vulnerability or 
threat. It is often used in food defence where controls are needed to prevent potential 
threats from occurring.

Monitoring A planned sequence of observations or measurements of defined control parameters to 
assess whether predefined limits are being met.

Non-conformity The non-fulfilment of a specified product safety, legal or quality requirement or a 
specified system requirement.

Online verification 
equipment

Automated equipment (e.g. bar code scanners) that are used to check the accuracy or 
quality of product labels and printing.

Open product area An area in which product is open to the environment (i.e. not fully enclosed in packaging 
or within equipment/pipes).

Outer packaging Packaging which is visible when the product is released from the site. For example, a 
cardboard box could be considered outer packaging even if wrapped in clear film.

Outsourced processing 
(subcontracted 
processing)

Outsourced processing (also referred to as subcontracted processing) is when 
intermediate production, processing, storage or a step in the manufacture of a product is 
completed at another company or site.

Outsourced processing is an intermediate step; therefore during outsourced processing, 
the product or partly processed product leaves the site being audited for the completion 
of the outsourced processing before returning to the site. The audited site may or may 
not complete the additional packing or processing steps of the product.

Where raw materials receive additional storage or processing prior to their arrival on 
site, this is not considered to be outsourced processing, but should be managed by the 
site using supplier approval mechanisms, raw material risk assessments and raw material 
specifications.

When a product leaves the site and does not return, this is not outsourced processing; 
the activities completed off site are outside the scope of the audit.

Ownership (change of 
company ownership)

A change of ownership occurs when the title is transferred from one individual or entity 
to another and results in a change of control of the organisation.

Performance indicators Summaries of quantified data that provide information on the level of compliance 
against agreed targets (e.g. customer complaints, product incidents, laboratory data).

Plant-based product A product that does not intentionally contain materials of animal origin, and has not 
intentionally used ingredients (including additives, carriers, flavourings and enzymes), 
processing aids or any other substances that are of animal origin, at any stage during 
production and processing.

Position statement Where clarification of the interpretation of a requirement of a BRCGS Standard or 
its protocol is necessary, this will be published on the BRCGS website as a position 
statement. Such statements are binding on the way that the audit and certification 
process are carried out and are considered to be an extension of the Standard. They are 
applicable from the date specified for implementation (or the date of publication on the 
BRCGS website, where no date is specified).

Positive release Ensuring a product or material is of an acceptable standard prior to release for use.

Potable water Water that is safe to drink, free from pollutants and harmful organisms, and conforms to 
local legal requirements.

Premises A physical building or place owned by the company and audited as part of a site.

Pre-packaged products Products in their final packaging that is designed for sale to the consumer.

Prepared primary 
product

A food product which has undergone a washing, trimming, size-grading or quality-
grading process and is pre-packed.

Prerequisite The basic environmental and operational conditions in a food business that are 
necessary for the production of safe food. These control generic hazards covering good 
manufacturing and hygiene practices, and form a foundation for the food safety or 
HACCP plan. Prerequisites shall be considered as part of that plan.

Preventive action Action to eliminate the fundamental underlying cause (root cause) of a detected non-
conformity and prevent recurrence.

Primary packaging The packaging that constitutes the unit of sale to the consumer or customer (e.g. bottle, 
closure, label and tamper-evident seal of a retail pack or a raw material bulk container). 
When identifying primary packaging, due consideration must be given to the processes 
that minimise or eliminate any risk which may result in contamination of a food product; 
for example:

• using suitable food contact materials
• consideration of anything that is applied onto the surface of a permeable food contact 

material (e.g. potential for migration of ink components through cardboard is a well-
documented risk that has affected a range of packaging).

As a general rule, the Standard would not expect transit materials to be classified as 
primary packaging (e.g. pallets, pallet wrap, shrink wrap, pallet sheets, labels or cable ties 
applied on the outside of the pallet wrap, recyclable and re-usable travel containers, and 
plastic crates used to hold glass bottles).

Procedure Agreed method of carrying out an activity or process which is implemented and 
documented in the form of detailed instructions or process description (e.g. a flowchart).

Processed food A food product which has undergone any of the following processes: aseptic filling, 
baking, battering, blending, bottling, breading, brewing, canning, coating, cooking, curing, 
cutting, dicing, distillation, drying, extrusion, fermentation, freeze drying, freezing, frying, 
hot filling, irradiation, microfiltration, microwaving, milling, mixing, being packed in 
modified atmosphere, being packed in vacuum packing, packing, pasteurisation, pickling, 
roasting, slicing, smoking, steaming or sterilisation.

Processing aid Any substance not consumed as a food by itself, intentionally used in the processing of 
raw materials, foods or their ingredients to fulfil a certain technological purpose during 
treatment or processing, and which may result in the unintentional but technically 
unavoidable presence of the residues of the substance or its derivatives in the final 
product – provided that these residues do not present any health risk and do not have 
any technological effect on the finished product.

Product recall Any measures aimed at achieving the removal of an unfit (e.g. unsafe) product from 
customers and final consumers.

for example, where the product has not reached the point of sale to consumers.

Production risk zones Zones or areas within the processing and storage facilities that require specified levels 
of hygiene and segregation to reduce the potential for product contamination with 
pathogenic micro-organisms. The Standard recognises five production risk zones:

• high risk
• high care
• ambient high care
• low risk
